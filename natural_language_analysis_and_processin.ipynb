              "'/ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED \\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, \\nwere proud to say that they were perfectly normal, \\nthank you very much. They were the last people you’d \\nexpect to be involved in anything strange or \\nmysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such \\nnonsense. \\n\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called \\nGrunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy \\nman with hardly any neck, although he did have a \\nvery large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and \\nblonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of \\nneck, which came in very useful as she spent so \\nmuch of her time craning over garden fences, spying \\non the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son \\ncalled Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \\nboy anywhere. \\n\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they \\nalso had a secret, and their greatest fear was that \\nsomebody would discover it. They didn’t think they \\ncould bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. \\nMrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmet for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended \\nshe didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her \\ngood-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it \\nwas possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think \\nwhat the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in \\nthe street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a \\nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him. \\n\\nThis boy was another good reason for keeping the \\nPotters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a \\nchild like that. \\n\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray \\nTuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the \\ncloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and \\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over \\nthe country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out \\nhis most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley \\ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming \\nDudley into his high chair. \\n\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past \\nthe window. \\n\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his \\nbriefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and \\ntried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because \\nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his \\ncereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley \\nas he left the house. He got into his car and backed \\nout of number four’s drive. \\n\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the \\nfirst sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a \\nmap. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he \\nhad seen — then he jerked his head around to look \\nagain. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \\nof Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What \\ncould he have been thinking of? It must have been a \\ntrick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around \\nthe corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his \\nmirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet \\nDrive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read \\nmaps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake \\nand put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward \\ntown he thought of nothing except a large order of \\ndrills he was hoping to get that day. \\n\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his \\nmind by something else. As he sat in the usual \\nmorning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that \\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people \\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear \\npeople who dressed in funny clothes — the getups \\nyou saw on young people! He supposed this was some \\nstupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the \\nsteering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these \\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering \\nexcitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see \\nthat a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that \\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an \\nemerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it \\nstruck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly \\nstunt — these people were obviously collecting for \\nsomething ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved \\non and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the \\nGrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \\n\\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in \\nhis office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might \\nhave found it harder to concentrate on drills that \\nmorning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in \\nbroad daylight, though people down in the street did; \\nthey pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after \\nowl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an \\nowl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a \\nperfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five \\ndifferent people. He made several important telephone \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncalls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good \\nmood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch \\nhis legs and walk across the road to buy himself a \\nbun from the bakery. \\n\\nHe’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he \\npassed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed \\nthem angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but \\nthey made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering \\nexcitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting \\ntin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a \\nlarge doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words \\nof what they were saying. \\n\\n“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” \\n\\n“ — yes, their son, Harry — ” \\n\\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He \\nlooked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say \\nsomething to them, but thought better of it. \\n\\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his \\noffice, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, \\nseized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing \\nhis home number when he changed his mind. He put \\nthe receiver back down and stroked his mustache, \\nthinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t \\nsuch an unusual name. He was sure there were lots \\nof people called Potter who had a son called Harry. \\nCome to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew \\nwas called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It \\nmight have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no \\npoint in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so \\nupset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame \\nher — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the \\nsame, those people in cloaks ... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that \\nafternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, \\nhe was still so worried that he walked straight into \\nsomeone just outside the door. \\n\\n“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled \\nand almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. \\nDursley realized that the man was wearing a violet \\ncloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost \\nknocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split \\ninto a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that \\nmade passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, \\nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- \\nKnow-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like \\nyourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy \\nday!” \\n\\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the \\nmiddle and walked off. \\n\\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been \\nhugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he \\nhad been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was \\nrattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, \\nhoping he was imagining things, which he had never \\nhoped before, because he didn’t approve of \\nimagination. \\n\\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the \\nfirst thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — \\nwas the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was \\nnow sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the \\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \\n\\n“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. \\n\\nThe cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. \\n\\nWas this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. \\nTrying to pull himself together, he let himself into the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhouse. He was still determined not to mention \\nanything to his wife. \\n\\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told \\nhim over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems \\nwith her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new \\nword (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. \\nWhen Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the \\nliving room in time to catch the last report on the \\nevening news: \\n\\n“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported \\nthat the nation’s owls have been behaving very \\nunusually today. Although owls normally hunt at \\nnight and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have \\nbeen hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in \\nevery direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to \\nexplain why the owls have suddenly changed their \\nsleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a \\ngrin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim \\nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more \\nshowers of owls tonight, Jim?” \\n\\n“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about \\nthat, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting \\noddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, \\nand Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that \\ninstead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a \\ndownpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have \\nbeen celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until \\nnext week, folks! But I can promise a wet night \\ntonight.” \\n\\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars \\nall over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious \\npeople in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a \\nwhisper about the Potters . . . \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two \\ncups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say \\nsomething to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er \\n— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister \\nlately, have you?” \\n\\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and \\nangry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t \\nhave a sister. \\n\\n“No,” she said sharply. “Why?” \\n\\n“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. \\n“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of \\nfunny-looking people in town today ...” \\n\\n“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. \\n\\n“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to \\ndo with ... you know ... her crowd.” \\n\\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. \\nDursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d \\nheard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. \\nInstead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — \\nhe’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” \\n\\n“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \\n\\n“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?” \\n\\n“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” \\n\\n“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking \\nhorribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” \\n\\nHe didn’t say another word on the subject as they \\nwent upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the \\nbathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand peered down into the front garden. The cat was \\nstill there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though \\nit were waiting for something. \\n\\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have \\nanything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out \\nthat they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t \\nthink he could bear it. \\n\\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep \\nquickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over \\nin his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell \\nasleep was that even if the Potters were involved, \\nthere was no reason for them to come near him and \\nMrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and \\nPetunia thought about them and their kind. ... He \\ncouldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up \\nin anything that might be going on — he yawned and \\nturned over — it couldn’t affect them. ... \\n\\nHow very wrong he was. \\n\\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy \\nsleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no \\nsign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, \\nits eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet \\nDrive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door \\nslammed on the next street, nor when two owls \\nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight \\nbefore the cat moved at all. \\n\\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been \\nwatching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d \\nhave thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The \\ncat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \\n\\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet \\nDrive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the \\nsilver of his hair and beard, which were both long \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long \\nrobes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and \\nhigh-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, \\nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles \\nand his nose was very long and crooked, as though it \\nhad been broken at least twice. This man’s name was \\nAlbus Dumbledore. \\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had \\njust arrived in a street where everything from his \\nname to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy \\nrummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But \\nhe did seem to realize he was being watched, because \\nhe looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still \\nstaring at him from the other end of the street. For \\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse \\nhim. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have \\nknown.” \\n\\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside \\npocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He \\nflicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. \\nThe nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He \\nclicked it again — the next lamp flickered into \\ndarkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, \\nuntil the only lights left on the whole street were two \\ntiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of \\nthe cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their \\nwindow now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they \\nwouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening \\ndown on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- \\nOuter back inside his cloak and set off down the \\nstreet toward number four, where he sat down on the \\nwall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a \\nmoment he spoke to it. \\n\\n“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. \\nInstead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking \\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its \\neyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. \\nHer black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She \\nlooked distinctly ruffled. \\n\\n“How did you know it was me?” she asked. \\n\\n“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” \\n\\n“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all \\nday,” said Professor McGonagall. \\n\\n“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I \\nmust have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my \\nway here.” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \\n\\n“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said \\nimpatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, \\nbut no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s \\ngoing on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head \\nback at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I \\nheard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, \\nthey’re not completely stupid. They were bound to \\nnotice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll \\nbet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much \\nsense.” \\n\\n“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. \\n“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven \\nyears.” \\n\\n“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. \\n\\n“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are \\nbeing downright careless, out on the streets in broad \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndaylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, \\nswapping rumors.” \\n\\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore \\nhere, as though hoping he was going to tell her \\nsomething, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine \\nthing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who \\nseems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found \\nout about us all. I suppose he really has gone, \\nDumbledore?” \\n\\n“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have \\nmuch to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon \\ndrop?” \\n\\n“A what?” \\n\\n“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m \\nrather fond of.” \\n\\n“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as \\nthough she didn’t think this was the moment for \\nlemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has \\ngone — ” \\n\\n“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like \\nyourself can call him by his name? All this You- \\nKnow-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been \\ntrying to persuade people to call him by his proper \\nname: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but \\nDumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, \\nseemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we \\nkeep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any \\nreason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.” \\n\\n“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, \\nsounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re \\ndifferent. Everyone knows you’re the only one You- \\nKnow- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort \\nhad powers I will never have.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use \\nthem.” \\n\\n“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since \\nMadam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at \\nDumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to \\nthe rumors that are flying around. You know what \\neveryone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? \\n\\nAbout what finally stopped him?” \\n\\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the \\npoint she was most anxious to discuss, the real \\nreason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all \\nday, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she \\nfixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she \\ndid now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was \\nsaying, she was not going to believe it until \\nDumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, \\nhowever, was choosing another lemon drop and did \\nnot answer. \\n\\n“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last \\nnight Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He \\nwent to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and \\nJames Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.” \\n\\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall \\ngasped. \\n\\n“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to \\nbelieve it ... Oh, Albus ...” \\n\\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the \\nshoulder. “I know ... I know ...” he said heavily. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went \\non. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the \\nPotters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t \\nkill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but \\nthey’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, \\nVoldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why \\nhe’s gone.” \\n\\nDumbledore nodded glumly. \\n\\n“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After \\nall he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t \\nkill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the \\nthings to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven \\ndid Harry survive?” \\n\\n“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may \\nnever know.” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief \\nand dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. \\nDumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden \\nwatch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very \\nodd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; \\ninstead, little planets were moving around the edge. It \\nmust have made sense to Dumbledore, though, \\nbecause he put it back in his pocket and said, \\n“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be \\nhere, by the way?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t \\nsuppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all \\nplaces?” \\n\\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. \\nThey’re the only family he has left now.” \\n\\n“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who \\nlive here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfeet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you \\ncan’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t \\nfind two people who are less like us. And they’ve got \\nthis son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way \\nup the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter \\ncome and live here!” \\n\\n“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. \\n“His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything \\nto him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.” \\n\\n“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, \\nsitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, \\nyou think you can explain all this in a letter? These \\npeople will never understand him! He’ll be famous — \\na legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was \\nknown as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will \\nbe books written about Harry — every child in our \\nworld will know his name!” \\n\\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously \\nover the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be \\nenough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can \\nwalk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even \\nremember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, \\ngrowing up away from all that until he’s ready to take \\nit?” \\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her \\nmind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re \\nright, of course. But how is the boy getting here, \\nDumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though \\nshe thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \\n\\n“Hagrid’s bringing him.” \\n\\n“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with \\nsomething as important as this?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said \\nProfessor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t \\npretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what \\nwas that?” \\n\\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around \\nthem. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and \\ndown the street for some sign of a headlight; it \\nswelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — \\nand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed \\non the road in front of them. \\n\\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man \\nsitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a \\nnormal man and at least five times as wide. He looked \\nsimply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long \\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his \\nface, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his \\nfeet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In \\nhis vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of \\nblankets. \\n\\n“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At \\nlast. And where did you get that motorcycle?” \\n\\n“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the \\ngiant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he \\nspoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, \\nsir.” \\n\\n“No problems, were there?” \\n\\n“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him \\nout all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ \\naround. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward \\nover the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a \\nbaby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair \\nover his forehead they could see a curiously shaped \\ncut, like a bolt of lightning. \\n\\n“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.” \\n\\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” \\n\\n“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. \\n\\nI have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect \\nmap of the London Underground. Well — give him \\nhere, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” \\n\\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned \\ntoward the Dursleys’ house. \\n\\n“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked \\nHagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry \\nand gave him what must have been a very scratchy, \\nwhiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl \\nlike a wounded dog. \\n\\n“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the \\nMuggles!” \\n\\n“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted \\nhandkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c- \\ncan’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little \\nHarry off ter live with Muggles — ” \\n\\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, \\nHagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall \\nwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as \\nDumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and \\nwalked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndoorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it \\ninside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the \\nother two. For a full minute the three of them stood \\nand looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders \\nshook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and \\nthe twinkling light that usually shone from \\nDumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. \\n\\n“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no \\nbusiness staying here. We may as well go and join the \\ncelebrations.” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best \\nget this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall — \\nProfessor Dumbledore, sir.” \\n\\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid \\nswung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the \\nengine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off \\ninto the night. \\n\\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” \\nsaid Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor \\nMcGonagall blew her nose in reply. \\n\\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. \\nOn the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- \\nOuter. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light \\nsped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive \\nglowed suddenly orange and he could make out a \\ntabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end \\nof the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets \\non the step of number four. \\n\\n“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his \\nheel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. \\n\\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which \\nlay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplace you would expect astonishing things to happen. \\nHarry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without \\nwaking up. One small hand closed on the letter \\nbeside him and he slept on, not knowing he was \\nspecial, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he \\nwould be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. \\n\\nDursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put \\nout the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next \\nfew weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin \\nDudley. ... He couldn’t know that at this very \\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country \\nwere holding up their glasses and saying in hushed \\nvoices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VANASHIG GLASS \\n\\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had \\nwoken up to find their nephew on the front step, but \\nPrivet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose \\non the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass \\nnumber four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into \\ntheir living room, which was almost exactly the same \\nas it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had \\nseen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the \\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how \\nmuch time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been \\nlots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \\nball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley \\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the \\nphotographs showed a large blond boy riding his first \\nbicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer \\ngame with his father, being hugged and kissed by his \\nmother. The room held no sign at all that another boy \\nlived in the house, too. \\n\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, \\nbut not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas her shrill voice that made the first noise of the \\nday. \\n\\n“Up! Get up! Now!” \\n\\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door \\nagain. \\n\\n“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward \\nthe kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan \\nbeing put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and \\ntried to remember the dream he had been having. It \\nhad been a good one. There had been a flying \\nmotorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the \\nsame dream before. \\n\\nHis aunt was back outside the door. \\n\\n“Are you up yet?” she demanded. \\n\\n“Nearly,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the \\nbacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want \\neverything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” \\n\\nHarry groaned. \\n\\n“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the \\ndoor. \\n\\n“Nothing, nothing ...” \\n\\nDudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? \\nHarry got slowly out of bed and started looking for \\nsocks. He found a pair under his bed and, after \\npulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry \\nwas used to spiders, because the cupboard under the \\nstairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the \\nkitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all \\nDudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though \\nDudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not \\nto mention the second television and the racing bike. \\nExactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a \\nmystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated \\nexercise — unless of course it involved punching \\nsomebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, \\nbut he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, \\nbut he was very fast. \\n\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark \\ncupboard, but Harry had always been small and \\nskinny for his age. He looked even smaller and \\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to \\nwear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was \\nabout four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin \\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green \\neyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot \\nof Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had \\npunched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked \\nabout his own appearance was a very thin scar on his \\nforehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He \\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the \\nfirst question he could ever remember asking his \\nAunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \\n\\n“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had \\nsaid. “And don’t ask questions.” \\n\\nDon’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a \\nquiet life with the Dursleys. \\n\\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was \\nturning over the bacon. \\n\\n“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning \\ngreeting. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top \\nof his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a \\nhaircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the \\nrest of the boys in his class put together, but it made \\nno difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over \\nthe place. \\n\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in \\nthe kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like \\nUncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much \\nneck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair \\nthat lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia \\noften said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — \\nHarry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a \\nwig. \\n\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, \\nwhich was difficult as there wasn’t much room. \\nDudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His \\nface fell. \\n\\n“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and \\nfather. “That’s two less than last year.” \\n\\n“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, \\nsee, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and \\nDaddy.” \\n\\n“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red \\nin the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley \\ntantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as \\nfast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. \\n\\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because \\nshe said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two \\npresents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? \\nTwo more presents. Is that all right?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard \\nwork. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ... \\nthirty ...” \\n\\n“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia. \\n\\n“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the \\nnearest parcel. “All right then.” \\n\\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \\n\\n“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his \\nfather. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair. \\n\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia \\nwent to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon \\nwatched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video \\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new \\ncomputer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the \\npaper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came \\nback from the telephone looking both angry and \\nworried. \\n\\n“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her \\nleg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in \\nHarry’s direction. \\n\\nDudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart \\ngave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his \\nparents took him and a friend out for the day, to \\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the \\nmovies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. \\nFigg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. \\n\\nHarry hated it there. The whole house smelled of \\ncabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs \\nof all the cats she’d ever owned. \\n\\n“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at \\nHarry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, \\nbut it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would \\nbe a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, \\nSnowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \\n\\n“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. \\n\\n“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” \\n\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as \\nthough he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was \\nsomething very nasty that couldn’t understand them, \\nlike a slug. \\n\\n“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — \\nYvonne?” \\n\\n“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia. \\n\\n“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully \\n(he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television \\nfor a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s \\ncomputer) . \\n\\nAunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a \\nlemon. \\n\\n“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she \\nsnarled. \\n\\n“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they \\nweren’t listening. \\n\\n“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt \\nPetunia slowly, \"... and leave him in the car. ...” \\n\\n“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really \\ncrying — it had been years since he’d really cried — \\nbut he knew that if he screwed up his face and \\nwailed, his mother would give him anything he \\nwanted. \\n\\n“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him \\nspoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms \\naround him. \\n\\n“I ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” Dudley \\nyelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp- \\nspoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through \\nthe gap in his mothers arms. \\n\\nJust then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, \\nthey’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a \\nmoment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, \\nwalked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy \\nwith a face like a rat. He was usually the one who \\nheld people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley \\nhit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. \\n\\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his \\nluck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with \\nPiers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first \\ntime in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able \\nto think of anything else to do with him, but before \\nthey’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \\n\\n“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large \\npurple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you \\nnow, boy — any funny business, anything at all — \\nand you’ll be in that cupboard from now until \\nChristmas.” \\n\\nI’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem was, strange things often happened \\naround Harry and it was just no good telling the \\nDursleys he didn’t make them happen. \\n\\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from \\nthe barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, \\nhad taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair \\nso short he was almost bald except for his bangs, \\nwhich she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had \\nlaughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless \\nnight imagining school the next day, where he was \\nalready laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped \\nglasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to \\nfind his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt \\nPetunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week \\nin his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to \\nexplain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown \\nback so quickly. \\n\\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force \\nhim into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown \\nwith orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it \\nover his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until \\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but \\ncertainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided \\nit must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great \\nrelief, Harry wasn’t punished. \\n\\nOn the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble \\nfor being found on the roof of the school kitchens. \\nDudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, \\nas much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he \\nwas sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had \\nreceived a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress \\ntelling them Harry had been climbing school \\nbuildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at \\nUncle Vernon through the locked door of his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans \\noutside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the \\nwind must have caught him in mid-jump. \\n\\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even \\nworth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the \\nday somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or \\nMrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. \\n\\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt \\nPetunia. He liked to complain about things: people at \\nwork, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry \\nwere just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, \\nit was motorcycles. \\n\\n\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” \\nhe said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \\n\\n“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, \\nremembering suddenly. “It was flying.” \\n\\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He \\nturned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, \\nhis face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \\n“MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” \\n\\nDudley and Piers sniggered. \\n\\n“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.” \\n\\nBut he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was \\none thing the Dursleys hated even more than his \\nasking questions, it was his talking about anything \\nacting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a \\ndream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he \\nmight get dangerous ideas. \\n\\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was \\ncrowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance \\nand then, because the smiling lady in the van had \\nasked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry \\nhim away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It \\nwasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they \\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked \\nremarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond. \\n\\nHarry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. \\nHe was careful to walk a little way apart from the \\nDursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting \\nto get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t \\nfall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They \\nate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a \\ntantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have \\nenough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him \\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. \\n\\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it \\nwas all too good to last. \\n\\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool \\nand dark in there, with lit windows all along the \\nwalls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes \\nwere crawling and slithering over bits of wood and \\nstone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, \\npoisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. \\nDudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It \\ncould have wrapped its body twice around Uncle \\nVernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at \\nthe moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was \\nfast asleep. \\n\\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, \\nstaring at the glistening brown coils. \\n\\n“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon \\ntapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped \\nthe glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake \\njust snoozed on. \\n\\n“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. \\n\\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently \\nat the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it \\nhad died of boredom itself — no company except \\nstupid people drumming their fingers on the glass \\ntrying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than \\nhaving a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only \\nvisitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to \\nwake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the \\nhouse. \\n\\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, \\nvery slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a \\nlevel with Harry’s. \\n\\nIt winked. \\n\\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if \\nanyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back \\nat the snake and winked, too. \\n\\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and \\nDudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave \\nHarry a look that said quite plainly: \\n\\n“I get that all the time.” \\n\\n“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though \\nhe wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be \\nreally annoying.” \\n\\nThe snake nodded vigorously. \\n\\n“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the \\nglass. Harry peered at it. \\n\\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil. \\n\\n“Was it nice there?” \\n\\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again \\nand Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the \\nzoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” \\n\\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout \\nbehind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! \\nMR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! \\nYOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” \\n\\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he \\ncould. \\n\\n“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the \\nribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the \\nconcrete floor. What came next happened so fast no \\none saw how it happened — one second, Piers and \\nDudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the \\nnext, they had leapt back with howls of horror. \\n\\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa \\nconstrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was \\nuncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. \\nPeople throughout the reptile house screamed and \\nstarted running for the exits. \\n\\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have \\nsworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. \\n... Thanksss, amigo.” \\n\\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass \\ngo?” \" \\n\\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of \\nstrong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over \\nagain. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as \\nHarry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything \\nexcept snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but \\nby the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, \\nDudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off \\nhis leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to \\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at \\nleast, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry \\nwas talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” \\n\\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the \\nhouse before starting on Harry. He was so angry he \\ncould hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — \\ncupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed \\ninto a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get \\nhim a large brandy. \\n\\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing \\nhe had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and \\nhe couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. \\n\\nUntil they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the \\nkitchen for some food. \\n\\nHe’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten \\nmiserable years, as long as he could remember, ever \\nsince he’d been a baby and his parents had died in \\nthat car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car \\nwhen his parents had died. Sometimes, when he \\nstrained his memory during long hours in his \\ncupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a \\nblinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his \\nforehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though \\nhe couldn’t imagine where all the green light came \\nfrom. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of \\ncourse he was forbidden to ask questions. There were \\nno photographs of them in the house. \\n\\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and \\ndreamed of some unknown relation coming to take \\nhim away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys \\nwere his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or \\nmaybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to \\nknow him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A \\ntiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once \\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. \\nAfter asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt \\nPetunia had rushed them out of the shop without \\nbuying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed \\nall in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. \\n\\nA bald man in a very long purple coat had actually \\nshaken his hand in the street the other day and then \\nwalked away without a word. The weirdest thing \\nabout all these people was the way they seemed to \\nvanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. \\n\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that \\nDudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his \\nbaggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody \\nliked to disagree with Dudley’s gang. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE \\n\\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned \\nHarry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he \\nwas allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer \\nholidays had started and Dudley had already broken \\nhis new video camera, crashed his remote control \\nairplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, \\nknocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet \\nDrive on her crutches. \\n\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no \\nescaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every \\nsingle day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were \\nall big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and \\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of \\nthem were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite \\nsport: Harry Hunting. \\n\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible \\nout of the house, wandering around and thinking \\nabout the end of the holidays, where he could see a \\ntiny ray of hope. When September came he would be \\ngoing off to secondary school and, for the first time in \\n\\n\\n\\nhis life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been \\naccepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, \\nSmeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, \\non the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the \\nlocal public school. Dudley thought this was very \\nfunny. \\n\\n“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day \\nat Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs \\nand practice?” \\n\\n“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had \\nanything as horrible as your head down it — it might \\nbe sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out \\nwhat he’d said. \\n\\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London \\nto buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. \\nFigg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out \\nshe’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and \\nshe didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She \\nlet Harry watch television and gave him a bit of \\nchocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for \\nseveral years. \\n\\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room \\nfor the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings \\nboys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, \\nand flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried \\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the \\nteachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be \\ngood training for later life. \\n\\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, \\nUncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest \\nmoment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and \\nsaid she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, \\nhe looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs \\nmight already have cracked from trying not to laugh. \\n\\n\\n\\nk k k \\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next \\nmorning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed \\nto be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He \\nwent to have a look. The tub was full of what looked \\nlike dirty rags swimming in gray water. \\n\\n“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips \\ntightened as they always did if he dared to ask a \\nquestion. \\n\\n“Your new school uniform,” she said. \\n\\nHarry looked in the bowl again. \\n\\n“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” \\n\\n“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing \\nsome of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just \\nlike everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” \\n\\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not \\nto argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to \\nthink about how he was going to look on his first day \\nat Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old \\nelephant skin, probably. \\n\\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with \\nwrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new \\nuniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as \\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which \\nhe carried everywhere, on the table. \\n\\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters \\non the doormat. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from \\nbehind his paper. \\n\\n“Make Harry get it.” \\n\\n“Get the mail, Harry.” \\n\\n“Make Dudley get it.” \\n\\n“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.” \\n\\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the \\nmail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard \\nfrom Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was \\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope \\nthat looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. \\n\\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging \\nlike a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole \\nlife, had written to him. Who would? He had no \\nfriends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the \\nlibrary, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for \\nbooks back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so \\nplainly there could be no mistake: \\n\\nMr. H. Potter \\n\\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs \\n4 Privet Drive \\nLittle Whinging \\nSurrey \\n\\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish \\nparchment, and the address was written in emerald- \\ngreen ink. There was no stamp. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry \\nsaw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, \\nan eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large \\nletter H. \\n\\n“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the \\nkitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter \\nbombs?” He chuckled at his own joke. \\n\\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his \\nletter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the \\npostcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the \\nyellow envelope. \\n\\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, \\nand flipped over the postcard. \\n\\n“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny \\nwhelk ...” \\n\\n“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got \\nsomething!” \\n\\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which \\nwas written on the same heavy parchment as the \\nenvelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand \\nby Uncle Vernon. \\n\\n“That’s mine\\\\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \\n\\n“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, \\nshaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at \\nit. His face went from red to green faster than a set of \\ntraffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds \\nit was the grayish white of old porridge. \\n\\n“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle \\nVernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia \\ntook it curiously and read the first line. For a moment \\nit looked as though she might faint. She clutched her \\nthroat and made a choking noise. \\n\\n“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!” \\n\\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten \\nthat Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley \\nwasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a \\nsharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \\n\\n“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly. \\n\\n“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” \\n\\n“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing \\nthe letter back inside its envelope. \\n\\nHarry didn’t move. \\n\\n“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted. \\n\\n“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley. \\n\\n“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry \\nand Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw \\nthem into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind \\nthem. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but \\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; \\nDudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one \\near, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack \\nbetween door and floor. \\n\\n“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering \\nvoice, “look at the address — how could they possibly \\nknow where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re \\nwatching the house?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Watching — spying — might be following us,” \\nmuttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \\n\\n“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write \\nback? Tell them we don’t want — ” \\n\\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes \\npacing up and down the kitchen. \\n\\n“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t \\nget an answer. ... Yes, that’s best ... we won’t do \\nanything. ...” \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we \\nswear when we took him in we’d stamp out that \\ndangerous nonsense?” \\n\\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle \\nVernon did something he’d never done before; he \\nvisited Harry in his cupboard. \\n\\n“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle \\nVernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s \\nwriting to me?” \\n\\n“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said \\nUncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.” \\n\\n“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my \\ncupboard on it.” \\n\\n“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of \\nspiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep \\nbreaths and then forced his face into a smile, which \\nlooked quite painful. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt \\nand I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit \\nbig for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved \\ninto Dudley’s second bedroom.” \\n\\n“Why?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this \\nstuff upstairs, now.” \\n\\nThe Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for \\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors \\n(usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where \\nDudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys \\nand things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It \\nonly took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything \\nhe owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat \\ndown on the bed and stared around him. Nearly \\neverything in here was broken. The month-old video \\ncamera was lying on top of a small, working tank \\nDudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s \\ndog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television \\nset, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite \\nprogram had been canceled; there was a large \\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley \\nhad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was \\nup on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley \\nhad sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They \\nwere the only things in the room that looked as \\nthough they’d never been touched. \\n\\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling \\nat his mother, “I don’t want him in there ... I need \\nthat room ... make him get out. ...” \\n\\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday \\nhe’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d \\nrather be back in his cupboard with that letter than \\nup here without it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. \\nDudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his \\nfather with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, \\nkicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through \\nthe greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room \\nback. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday \\nand bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. \\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each \\nother darkly. \\n\\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to \\nbe trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get \\nit. They heard him banging things with his Smelting \\nstick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \\n“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest \\nBedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ’ ” \\n\\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his \\nseat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. \\nUncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to \\nget the letter from him, which was made difficult by \\nthe fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around \\nthe neck from behind. After a minute of confused \\nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the \\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, \\ngasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his \\nhand. \\n\\n“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he \\nwheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.” \\n\\nHarry walked round and round his new room. \\nSomeone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and \\nthey seemed to know he hadn’t received his first \\nletter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this \\ntime he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan. \\n\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next \\nmorning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsilently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole \\ndownstairs without turning on any of the lights. \\n\\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of \\nPrivet Drive and get the letters for number four first. \\nHis heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall \\ntoward the front door — \\n\\n“AAAAARRRGH ! ” \\n\\nHarry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something \\nbig and squashy on the doormat — something alive\\\\ \\n\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry \\nrealized that the big, squashy something had been his \\nuncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot \\nof the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making \\nsure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been \\ntrying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an \\nhour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. \\nHarry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by \\nthe time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into \\nUncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters \\naddressed in green ink. \\n\\n“I want — ” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing \\nthe letters into pieces before his eyes. \\n\\nUncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at \\nhome and nailed up the mail slot. \\n\\n“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a \\nmouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll \\njust give up.” \\n\\n“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.” \\n\\n“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, \\nPetunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of \\nfruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. \\n\\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for \\nHarry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they \\nhad been pushed under the door, slotted through the \\nsides, and a few even forced through the small \\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom. \\n\\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all \\nthe letters, he got out a hammer and nails and \\nboarded up the cracks around the front and back \\ndoors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe \\nThrough the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at \\nsmall noises. \\n\\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. \\nTwenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the \\nhouse, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two \\ndozen eggs that their very confused milkman had \\nhanded Aunt Petunia through the living room \\nwindow. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone \\ncalls to the post office and the dairy trying to find \\nsomeone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the \\nletters in her food processor. \\n\\n“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” \\nDudley asked Harry in amazement. \\n\\n\\n\\n•k k k \\n\\n\\n\\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the \\nbreakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \\n\\n“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully \\nas he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no \\ndamn letters today — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney \\nas he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of \\nthe head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came \\npelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys \\nducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch \\none — \\n\\n“Out! OUT!” \\n\\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and \\nthrew him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and \\nDudley had run out with their arms over their faces, \\nUncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could \\nhear the letters still streaming into the room, \\nbouncing off the walls and floor. \\n\\n“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak \\ncalmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at \\nthe same time. “I want you all back here in five \\nminutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack \\nsome clothes. No arguments!” \\n\\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache \\nmissing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later \\nthey had wrenched their way through the boarded-up \\ndoors and were in the car, speeding toward the \\nhighway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his \\nfather had hit him round the head for holding them \\nup while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and \\ncomputer in his sports bag. \\n\\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t \\ndare ask where they were going. Every now and then \\nUncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in \\nthe opposite direction for a while. \\n\\n“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” he would mutter \\nwhenever he did this. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall \\nDudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day \\nin his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television \\nprograms he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so \\nlong without blowing up an alien on his computer. \\n\\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- \\nlooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley \\nand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, \\nmusty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, \\nsitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of \\npassing cars and wondering... \\n\\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on \\ntoast for breakfast the next day. They had just \\nfinished when the owner of the hotel came over to \\ntheir table. \\n\\n“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I \\ngot about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” \\n\\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink \\naddress: \\n\\nMr. H. Potter \\n\\nRoom 1 7 \\n\\nRailview Hotel \\n\\nCokeworth \\n\\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon \\nknocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \\n\\n“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up \\nquickly and following her from the dining room. \\n\\n•k k k \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt \\nPetunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle \\nVernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was \\nlooking for, none of them knew. He drove them into \\nthe middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook \\nhis head, got back in the car, and off they went again. \\nThe same thing happened in the middle of a plowed \\nfield, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the \\ntop of a multilevel parking garage. \\n\\n“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt \\nPetunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had \\nparked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, \\nand disappeared. \\n\\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the \\ncar. Dudley sniveled. \\n\\n“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great \\nHumberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with \\na television.” \\n\\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was \\nMonday — and you could usually count on Dudley to \\nknow the days of the week, because of television — \\nthen tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh \\nbirthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly \\nfun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat \\nhanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, \\nyou weren’t eleven every day. \\n\\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was \\nalso carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer \\nAunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought. \\n\\n“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! \\n\\nEveryone out!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was \\npointing at what looked like a large rock way out at \\nsea. Perched on top of the rock was the most \\nmiserable little shack you could imagine. One thing \\nwas certain, there was no television in there. \\n\\n“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon \\ngleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this \\ngentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” \\n\\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, \\npointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat \\nbobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \\n\\n“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, \\n“so all aboard!” \\n\\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain \\ncrept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped \\ntheir faces. After what seemed like hours they \\nreached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and \\nsliding, led the way to the broken-down house. \\n\\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of \\nseaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the \\nwooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. \\nThere were only two rooms. \\n\\nUncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips \\neach and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the \\nempty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \\n\\n“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said \\ncheerfully. \\n\\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought \\nnobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a \\nstorm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though \\nthe thought didn’t cheer him up at all. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around \\nthem. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls \\nof the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy \\nwindows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in \\nthe second room and made up a bed for Dudley on \\nthe moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off \\nto the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find \\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under \\nthe thinnest, most ragged blanket. \\n\\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the \\nnight went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and \\nturned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach \\nrumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned \\nby the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. \\nThe lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was \\ndangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told \\nHarry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and \\nwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the \\nDursleys would remember at all, wondering where the \\nletter writer was now. \\n\\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak \\noutside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, \\nalthough he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes \\nto go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so \\nfull of letters when they got back that he’d be able to \\nsteal one somehow. \\n\\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard \\non the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what \\nwas that funny crunching noise? Was the rock \\ncrumbling into the sea? \\n\\nOne minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds \\n... twenty ... ten ... nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley \\nup, just to annoy him — three ... two ... one ... \\n\\nBOOM. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, \\nstaring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking \\nto come in. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS \\n\\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \\n\\n“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly. \\n\\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon \\ncame skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in \\nhis hands — now they knew what had been in the \\nlong, thin package he had brought with them. \\n\\n“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!” \\n\\nThere was a pause. Then — \\n\\nSMASH! \\n\\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean \\noff its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat \\non the floor. \\n\\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His \\nface was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy \\nmane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmake out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under \\nall the hair. \\n\\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so \\nthat his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, \\npicked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its \\nframe. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. \\nHe turned to look at them all. \\n\\n“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not \\nbeen an easy journey. ...” \\n\\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen \\nwith fear. \\n\\n“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. \\n\\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, \\nwho was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \\n\\n“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant. \\n\\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face \\nand saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \\n\\n“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the \\ngiant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer \\nmom’s eyes.” \\n\\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \\n\\n“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You \\nare breaking and entering!” \\n\\n“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the \\ngiant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the \\ngun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot \\nas easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw \\nit into a corner of the room. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a \\nmouse being trodden on. \\n\\n“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back \\non the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got \\nsummat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some \\npoint, but it’ll taste all right.” \\n\\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled \\na slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with \\ntrembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate \\ncake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green \\nicing. \\n\\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank \\nyou, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, \\nand what he said instead was, “Who are you?” \\n\\nThe giant chuckled. \\n\\n“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, \\nKeeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” \\n\\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s \\nwhole arm. \\n\\n“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his \\nhands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if \\nyeh’ve got it, mind.” \\n\\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled \\nchip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the \\nfireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but \\nwhen he drew back a second later, there was a \\nroaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with \\nflickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over \\nhim as though he’d sunk into a hot bath. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged \\nunder his weight, and began taking all sorts of things \\nout of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a \\nsquashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, \\nseveral chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber \\nliquid that he took a swig from before starting to \\nmake tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and \\nsmell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while \\nthe giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, \\njuicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley \\nfidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t \\ntouch anything he gives you, Dudley.” \\n\\nThe giant chuckled darkly. \\n\\n“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ \\nanymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” \\n\\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry \\nhe had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he \\nstill couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as \\nnobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \\n“I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” \\n\\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with \\nthe back of his hand. \\n\\n“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I \\ntold yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll \\nknow all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” \\n\\n“Er — no,” said Harry. \\n\\nHagrid looked shocked. \\n\\n“Sorry,” Harry said quickly. \\n\\n“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the \\nDursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthem as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ \\nyer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even \\nknow abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh \\nnever wonder where yer parents learned it all?” \\n\\n“All what?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one \\nsecond!” \\n\\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill \\nthe whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against \\nthe wall. \\n\\n“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, \\n“that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — \\nabout ANYTHING?” \\n\\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to \\nschool, after all, and his marks weren’t bad. \\n\\n“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do \\nmath and stuff.” \\n\\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About \\nour world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ \\nworld.” \\n\\n“What world?” \\n\\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \\n“DURSLEY!” he boomed. \\n\\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered \\nsomething that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid \\nstared wildly at Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he \\nsaid. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.” \\n\\n“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were \\nthey?” \\n\\n“Yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran his \\nfingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a \\nbewildered stare. \\n\\n“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally. \\n\\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \\n\\n“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid \\nyou to tell the boy anything!” \\n\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have \\nquailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; \\nwhen Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with \\nrage. \\n\\n“You never told him? Never told him what was in the \\nletter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw \\nDumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from \\nhim all these years?” \\n\\n“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly. \\n\\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. \\n\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \\n\\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. \\n“Harry — yer a wizard.” \\n\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and \\nthe whistling wind could be heard. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down \\non the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ \\na thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained \\nup a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else \\nwould yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read \\nyer letter.” \\n\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the \\nyellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. \\nH. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He \\npulled out the letter and read: \\n\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL \\no/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY \\n\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \\n\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf. \\n\\nWarlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of \\nWizards) \\n\\nDear Mr. Potter, \\n\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been \\naccepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and \\nWizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary \\nbooks and equipment. \\n\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no \\nlater than July 31. \\n\\nYours sincerely, \\n\\nMinerva McGonagall, \\n\\nDeputy Headmistress \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks \\nand he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few \\nminutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they \\nawait my owl?” \\n\\n“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, \\nclapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to \\nknock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket \\ninside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, \\nrather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of \\nparchment. With his tongue between his teeth he \\nscribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: \\n\\nDear Professor Dumbledore, \\n\\nGiven Harry his letter. \\n\\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow. \\n\\nWeather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. \\n\\nHagrid \\n\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which \\nclamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw \\nthe owl out into the storm. Then he came back and \\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on \\nthe telephone. \\n\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it \\nquickly. \\n\\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, \\n\\nUncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very \\nangry, moved into the firelight. \\n\\n“He’s not going,” he said. \\n\\nHagrid grunted. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\n\\n“A what?” said Harry, interested. \\n\\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic \\nfolk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a \\nfamily o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” \\n\\n“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to \\nthat rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp \\nit out of him! Wizard indeed!” \\n\\n“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a \\nwizard?” \\n\\n“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew\\\\ Of \\ncourse we knew! How could you not be, my dratted \\nsister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just \\nlike that and disappeared off to that — that school — \\nand came home every vacation with her pockets full \\nof frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the \\nonly one who saw her for what she was — a freak! \\n\\nBut for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this \\nand Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in \\nthe family!” \\n\\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went \\nranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all \\nthis for years. \\n\\n“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and \\ngot married and had you, and of course I knew you’d \\nbe just the same, just as strange, just as — as — \\nabnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got \\nherself blown up and we got landed with you!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his \\nvoice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a \\ncar crash!” \\n\\n“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily \\nthat the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How \\ncould a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an \\noutrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own \\nstory when every kid in our world knows his name!” \\n\\n“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently. \\n\\nThe anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked \\nsuddenly anxious. \\n\\n“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried \\nvoice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there \\nmight be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh \\ndidn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right \\nperson ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t \\ngo off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” \\n\\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \\n\\n“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — \\nmind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, \\nparts of it. ...” \\n\\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, \\nand then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a \\nperson called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his \\nname, everyone in our world knows — ” \\n\\n“Who?” \\n\\n“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No \\none does.” \\n\\n“Why not?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. \\nBlimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard \\nwho went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. \\nWorse than worse. His name was ...” \\n\\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out. \\n\\n“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. \\n\\n“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid \\nshuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this \\n— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started \\nlookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, \\nsome just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was \\ngettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. \\nDidn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly \\nwith strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things \\nhappened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up \\nto him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only \\nsafe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s \\nthe only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare \\ntry takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. \\n\\n“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ \\nwizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts \\nin their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know- \\nWho never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . \\nprobably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter \\nwant anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. \\n\\n“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em ... maybe \\nhe just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows \\nis, he turned up in the village where you was all \\nliving, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a \\nyear old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” \\n\\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted \\nhandkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a \\nfoghorn. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum \\nan’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway \\n\\n\\n\\n“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the \\nreal myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. \\nWanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or \\nmaybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do \\nit. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer \\nforehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh \\nget when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took \\ncare of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it \\ndidn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. \\nNo one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one \\nexcept you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches \\nan’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, \\nthe Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you \\nlived.” \\n\\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. \\nAs Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the \\nblinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had \\never remembered it before — and he remembered \\nsomething else, for the first time in his life: a high, \\ncold, cruel laugh. \\n\\nHagrid was watching him sadly. \\n\\n“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on \\nDumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...” \\n\\n“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; \\nhe had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. \\nUncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his \\ncourage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were \\nclenched. \\n\\n“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept \\nthere’s something strange about you, probably \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as \\nfor all this about your parents, well, they were \\nweirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off \\nwithout them in my opinion — asked for all they got, \\ngetting mixed up with these wizarding types — just \\nwhat I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky \\nend — ” \\n\\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and \\ndrew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. \\nPointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \\n“I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one \\nmore word ...” \\n\\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella \\nby a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed \\nagain; he flattened himself against the wall and fell \\nsilent. \\n\\n“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and \\nsitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged \\nright down to the floor. \\n\\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, \\nhundreds of them. \\n\\n“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You- \\nKnow-Who?” \\n\\n“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same \\nnight he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more \\nfamous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... he was \\ngettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go? \\n\\n“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno \\nif he had enough human left in him to die. Some say \\nhe’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ \\nbelieve it. People who was on his side came back ter \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ \\nreckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back. \\n\\n“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but \\nlost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause \\nsomethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was \\nsomethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — \\n/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ \\nabout you stumped him, all right.” \\n\\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect \\nblazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling \\npleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a \\nhorrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he \\npossibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by \\nDudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle \\nVernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they \\nbeen turned into warty toads every time they’d tried \\nto lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the \\ngreatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had \\nalways been able to kick him around like a football? \\n\\n“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have \\nmade a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” \\n\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \\n\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when \\nyou was scared or angry?” \\n\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think \\nabout it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his \\naunt and uncle furious with him had happened when \\nhe, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by \\nDudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of \\ntheir reach . . . dreading going to school with that \\nridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow \\nback . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he \\nwas doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him? \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that \\nHagrid was positively beaming at him. \\n\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you \\nwait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” \\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a \\nfight. \\n\\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s \\ngoing to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve \\nread those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — \\nspell books and wands and — ” \\n\\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop \\nhim,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s \\nson goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been \\ndown ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest \\nschool of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven \\nyears there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with \\nyoungsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be \\nunder the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, \\nAlbus Dumbled — ” \\n\\n“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD \\nFOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle \\nVernon. \\n\\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his \\numbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER — ” he \\nthundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE \\n— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” \\n\\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the \\nair to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet \\nlight, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with \\nhis hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in \\npain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a \\ncurly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. \\n\\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and \\nDudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified \\nlook at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. \\n\\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his \\nbeard. \\n\\n“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it \\ndidn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, \\nbut I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there \\nwasn’t much left ter do.” \\n\\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy \\neyebrows. \\n\\n“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at \\nHogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do \\nmagic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter \\nfollow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ \\nthe reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ” \\n\\n“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — \\ngot expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. \\nThey snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But \\nDumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great \\nman, Dumbledore.” \\n\\n“Why were you expelled?” \\n\\n“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” \\nsaid Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer \\nbooks an’ that.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it \\nwriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in \\none o’ the pockets.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDIAGON ALLY \\n\\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he \\ncould tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. \\n\\n“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a \\ngiant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a \\nschool for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at \\nhome in my cupboard.” \\n\\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise. \\n\\nAnd there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry \\nthought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his \\neyes. It had been such a good dream. \\n\\nTap. Tap. Tap. \\n\\n“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” \\n\\nHe sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off him. The \\nhut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid \\nhimself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas an owl rapping its claw on the window, a \\nnewspaper held in its beak. \\n\\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as \\nthough a large balloon was swelling inside him. He \\nwent straight to the window and jerked it open. The \\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of \\nHagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered \\nonto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat. \\n\\n“Don’t do that.” \\n\\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it \\nsnapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on \\nsavaging the coat. \\n\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl — ” \\n\\n“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the \\npockets.” \\n\\nHagrid ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but \\npockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of \\nstring, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harry \\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \\n\\n“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily. \\n\\n“Knuts?” \\n\\n“The little bronze ones.” \\n\\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl \\nheld out his leg so Harry could put the money into a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsmall leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off \\nthrough the open window. \\n\\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \\n\\n“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter \\nLondon an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” \\n\\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking \\nat them. He had just thought of something that made \\nhim feel as though the happy balloon inside him had \\ngot a puncture. \\n\\n“Urn — Hagrid?” \\n\\n“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge \\nboots. \\n\\n“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle \\nVernon last night ... he won’t pay for me to go and \\nlearn magic.” \\n\\n“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up \\nand scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents \\ndidn’t leave yeh anything?” \\n\\n“But if their house was destroyed — ” \\n\\n“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, \\nfirst stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a \\nsausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no \\nteh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” \\n\\n“Wizards have banks?” \\n\\n“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” \\n\\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Goblins?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh \\nthat. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the \\nsafest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter \\nkeep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ \\nfact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. \\nHogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \\n“He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. \\nFetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows \\nhe can trust me, see. \\n\\n“Got everythin’? Come on, then.” \\n\\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was \\nquite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. \\nThe boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with \\na lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \\n\\n“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around \\nfor another boat. \\n\\n“Flew,” said Hagrid. \\n\\n“Flew?” \\n\\n“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter \\nuse magic now I’ve got yeh.” \\n\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at \\nHagrid, trying to imagine him flying. \\n\\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving \\nHarry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er \\n— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not \\nmentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” \\n\\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. \\nHagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward \\nland. \\n\\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” \\nHarry asked. \\n\\n“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his \\nnewspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons \\nguardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta \\nfind yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under \\nLondon, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die \\nof hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter \\nget yer hands on summat.” \\n\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read \\nhis newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned \\nfrom Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone \\nwhile they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d \\nnever had so many questions in his life. \\n\\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid \\nmuttered, turning the page. \\n\\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he \\ncould stop himself. \\n\\n“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer \\nMinister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so \\nold Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there \\nwas one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every \\nmorning, askin’ fer advice.” \\n\\n“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?” \\n\\n“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles \\nthat there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the \\ncountry.” \\n\\n“Why?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic \\nsolutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left \\nalone.” \\n\\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the \\nharbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and \\nthey clambered up the stone steps onto the street. \\n\\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked \\nthrough the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t \\nblame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as \\nanyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary \\nthings like parking meters and saying loudly, “See \\nthat, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” \\n\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep \\nup, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?” \\n\\n“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a \\ndragon.” \\n\\n“You’d like one?” \\n\\n“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” \\n\\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to \\nLondon in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t \\nunderstand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the \\nbills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. \\n\\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid \\ntook up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a \\ncanary-yellow circus tent. \\n\\n“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted \\nstitches. \\n\\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything \\nyeh need.” \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t \\nnoticed the night before, and read: \\n\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL \\no/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY \\n\\nUNIFORM \\n\\n\\n\\nFirst-year students will require: \\n\\n1 . Three sets of plain work robes (black) \\n\\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear \\n\\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or \\nsimilar) \\n\\n4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) \\n\\nPlease note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name \\ntags \\n\\n\\n\\nCOURSE BOOKS \\n\\n\\n\\nAll students should have a copy of each of the \\nfollowing: \\n\\nThe Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda \\nGoshawk \\n\\nA History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot \\n\\nMagical Theory by Adalbert Waffling \\n\\nA Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric \\nSwitch \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida \\nSpore \\n\\nMagical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger \\n\\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt \\nScamander \\n\\nThe Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin \\nTrimble \\n\\n\\n\\nOTHER EQUIPMENT \\n\\n\\n\\n1 wand \\n\\n1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) \\n\\n1 set glass or crystal phials \\n1 telescope \\n1 set brass scales \\n\\nStudents may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad \\n\\nPARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE \\nNOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS \\n\\n“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered \\naloud. \\n\\n“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid. \\n\\nHarry had never been to London before. Although \\nHagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was \\nobviously not used to getting there in an ordinary \\nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the \\nUnderground, and complained loudly that the seats \\nwere too small and the trains too slow. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without \\nmagic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down \\nescalator that led up to a bustling road lined with \\nshops. \\n\\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; \\nall Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They \\npassed book shops and music stores, hamburger \\nrestaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as \\nif it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an \\nordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there \\nreally be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath \\nthem? Were there really shops that sold spell books \\nand broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge \\njoke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t \\nknown that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he \\nmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though \\neverything Hagrid had told him so far was \\nunbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him. \\n\\n“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky \\nCauldron. It’s a famous place.” \\n\\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t \\npointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was \\nthere. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their \\neyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the \\nrecord shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the \\nLeaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most \\npeculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. \\nBefore he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him \\ninside. \\n\\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A \\nfew old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny \\nglasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long \\npipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old \\nbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a \\ntoothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen they walked in. Everyone seemed to know \\nHagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the \\nbartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, \\nHagrid?” \\n\\n“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, \\nclapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and \\nmaking Harry’s knees buckle. \\n\\n“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is \\nthis — can this be — ?” \\n\\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely \\nstill and silent. \\n\\n“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry \\nPotter ... what an honor.” \\n\\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward \\nHarry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \\n\\n“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.” \\n\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking \\nat him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it \\nwithout realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was \\nbeaming. \\n\\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the \\nnext moment, Harry found himself shaking hands \\nwith everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \\n\\n“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting \\nyou at last.” \\n\\n“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.” \\n\\n“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a \\nflutter.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the \\nname, Dedalus Diggle.” \\n\\n“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s \\ntop hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me \\nonce in a shop.” \\n\\n“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking \\naround at everyone. “Did you hear that? He \\nremembers me!” \\n\\nHarry shook hands again and again — Doris \\nCrockford kept coming back for more. \\n\\nA pale young man made his way forward, very \\nnervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \\n\\n“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor \\nQuirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” \\n\\n“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping \\nHarry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to \\nmeet you.” \\n\\n“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?” \\n\\n“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered \\nProfessor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think \\nabout it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” \\n\\nHe laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your \\nequipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- \\nbook on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at \\nthe very thought. \\n\\nBut the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep \\nHarry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get \\naway from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make \\nhimself heard over the babble. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.” \\n\\nDoris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, \\nand Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a \\nsmall, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but \\na trash can and a few weeds. \\n\\nHagrid grinned at Harry. \\n\\n“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even \\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\nyou, he’s usually tremblin’.” \\n\\n“Is he always that nervous?” \\n\\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine \\nwhile he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a \\nyear off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say \\nhe met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a \\nnasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same \\nsince. Scared of the students, scared of his own \\nsubject — now, where’s me umbrella?” \\n\\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. \\n\\nHagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall \\nabove the trash can. \\n\\n“Three up ... two across ...” he muttered. “Right, \\nstand back, Harry.” \\n\\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his \\numbrella. \\n\\nThe brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in \\nthe middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider \\nand wider — a second later they were facing an \\narchway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway \\nonto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of \\nsight. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” \\n\\nHe grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped \\nthrough the archway. Harry looked quickly over his \\nshoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back \\ninto solid wall. \\n\\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons \\noutside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — \\nCopper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — \\nCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \\n\\n“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we \\ngotta get yer money first.” \\n\\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He \\nturned his head in every direction as they walked up \\nthe street, trying to look at everything at once: the \\nshops, the things outside them, the people doing their \\nshopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary \\nwas shaking her head as they passed, saying, \\n\\n“Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.” \\n\\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign \\nsaying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, \\nBarn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about \\nHarry’s age had their noses pressed against a window \\nwith broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of \\nthem say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest \\never — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling \\ntelescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had \\nnever seen before, windows stacked with barrels of \\nbat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell \\nbooks, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, \\nglobes of the moon. ... \\n\\n“Gringotts,” said Hagrid. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey had reached a snowy white building that \\ntowered over the other little shops. Standing beside \\nits burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of \\nscarlet and gold, was — \\n\\n“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they \\nwalked up the white stone steps toward him. The \\ngoblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a \\nswarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry \\nnoticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they \\nwalked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of \\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon \\nthem: \\n\\nEnter, stranger, but take heed \\n\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed, \\n\\nFor those who take, but do not earn, \\n\\nMust pay most dearly in their turn. \\n\\nSo if you seek beneath our floors \\n\\nA treasure that was never yours, \\n\\nThief, you have been warned, beware \\n\\nOf finding more than treasure there. \\n\\n“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said \\nHagrid. \\n\\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors \\nand they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred \\nmore goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long \\ncounter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in \\nbrass scales, examining precious stones through \\neyeglasses. There were too many doors to count \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleading off the hall, and yet more goblins were \\nshowing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry \\nmade for the counter. \\n\\n“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come \\nter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” \\n\\n“You have his key, sir?” \\n\\n“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started \\nemptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a \\nhandful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of \\nnumbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry \\nwatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of \\nrubies as big as glowing coals. \\n\\n“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden \\nkey. \\n\\nThe goblin looked at it closely. \\n\\n“That seems to be in order.” \\n\\n“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor \\nDumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out \\nhis chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault \\nseven hundred and thirteen.” \\n\\nThe goblin read the letter carefully. \\n\\n“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will \\nhave someone take you down to both vaults. \\nGriphook!” \\n\\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had \\ncrammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, \\nhe and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the \\ndoors leading off the hall. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred \\nand thirteen?” Harry asked. \\n\\n“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very \\nsecret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. \\nMore’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” \\n\\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who \\nhad expected more marble, was surprised. They were \\nin a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming \\ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were \\nlittle railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled \\nand a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward \\nthem. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty \\n— and were off. \\n\\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting \\npassages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, \\nleft, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The \\nrattling cart seemed to know its own way, because \\nGriphook wasn’t steering. \\n\\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, \\nbut he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw \\na burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted \\naround to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they \\nplunged even deeper, passing an underground lake \\nwhere huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the \\nceiling and floor. \\n\\n“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise \\nof the cart, “what’s the difference between a \\nstalagmite and a stalactite?” \\n\\n“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ \\nask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be \\nsick.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at \\nlast beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid \\ngot out and had to lean against the wall to stop his \\nknees from trembling. \\n\\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke \\ncame billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. \\nInside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. \\nHeaps of little bronze Knuts. \\n\\n“All yours,” smiled Hagrid. \\n\\nAll Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t \\nhave known about this or they’d have had it from him \\nfaster than blinking. How often had they complained \\nhow much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time \\nthere had been a small fortune belonging to him, \\nburied deep under London. \\n\\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \\n\\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. \\n\\n“Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine \\nKnuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should \\nbe enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest \\nsafe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven \\nhundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go \\nmore slowly?” \\n\\n“One speed only,” said Griphook. \\n\\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering \\nspeed. The air became colder and colder as they \\nhurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over \\nan underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the \\nside to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, \\nbut Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff \\nof his neck. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \\n\\n“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked \\nthe door gently with one of his long fingers and it \\nsimply melted away. \\n\\n“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be \\nsucked through the door and trapped in there,” said \\nGriphook. \\n\\n“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” \\nHarry asked. \\n\\n“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a \\nrather nasty grin. \\n\\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this \\ntop security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned \\nforward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at \\nthe very least — but at first he thought it was empty. \\nThen he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up \\nin brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up \\nand tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to \\nknow what it was, but knew better than to ask. \\n\\n“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to \\nme on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth \\nshut,” said Hagrid. \\n\\n\\n\\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the \\nsunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where \\nto run first now that he had a bag full of money. He \\ndidn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to \\na pound to know that he was holding more money \\nthan he’d had in his whole life — more money than \\neven Dudley had ever had. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding \\ntoward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. \\n“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a \\npick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them \\nGringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry \\nentered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. \\n\\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all \\nin mauve. \\n\\n“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to \\nspeak. “Got the lot here — another young man being \\nfitted up just now, in fact.” \\n\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed \\nface was standing on a footstool while a second witch \\npinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood \\nHarry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over \\nhis head, and began to pin it to the right length. \\n\\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. \\n\\n“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s \\nup the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had \\na bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them \\noff to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years \\ncan’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into \\ngetting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” \\n\\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \\n\\n“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on. \\n\\n“No,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Play Quidditch at all?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth \\nQuidditch could be. \\n\\n“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to \\nplay for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know \\nwhat House you 11 be in yet?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \\n\\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do \\nthey, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family \\nhave been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d \\nleave, wouldn’t you?” \\n\\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a \\nbit more interesting. \\n\\n“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, \\nnodding toward the front window. Hagrid was \\nstanding there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two \\nlarge ice creams to show he couldn’t come in. \\n\\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know \\nsomething the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.” \\n\\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of \\nservant, isn’t he?” \\n\\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the \\nboy less and less every second. \\n\\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a \\nhut on the school grounds and every now and then he \\ngets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire \\nto his bed.” \\n\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he \\nwith you? Where are your parents?” \\n\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel \\nmuch like going into the matter with this boy. \\n\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \\n“But they were our kind, weren’t they?” \\n\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you \\nmean.” \\n\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, \\ndo you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been \\nbrought up to know our ways. Some of them have \\nnever even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, \\nimagine. I think they should keep it in the old \\nwizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” \\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \\n“That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for \\nan excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down \\nfrom the footstool. \\n\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the \\ndrawling boy. \\n\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid \\nhad bought him (chocolate and raspberry with \\nchopped nuts). \\n\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid. \\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment \\nand quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a \\nbottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When \\nthey had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s \\nQuidditch?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — \\nnot knowin’ about Quidditch!” \\n\\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told \\nHagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. \\n\\n“ — and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t \\neven be allowed in — ” \\n\\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh \\nwere — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his \\nparents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in \\nthe Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. \\nAnyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best \\nI ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a \\nlong line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what \\nshe had fer a sister!” \\n\\n“So what is Quidditch?” \\n\\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in \\nthe Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — \\nplayed up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four \\nballs — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” \\n\\n“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” \\n\\n“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says \\nHufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ” \\n\\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily. \\n\\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. \\n“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad \\nwho wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.” \\n\\n“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” \\n\\n“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey bought Harry’s school books in a shop called \\nFlourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to \\nthe ceiling with books as large as paving stones \\nbound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in \\ncovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a \\nfew books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, \\nwho never read anything, would have been wild to get \\nhis hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to \\ndrag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses \\n(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies \\nwith the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, \\nTongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor \\nVindictus Viridian. \\n\\n“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.” \\n\\n“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter \\nuse magic in the Muggle world except in very special \\ncircumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh \\ncouldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot \\nmore study before yeh get ter that level.” \\n\\nHagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, \\neither (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice \\nset of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a \\ncollapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the \\nApothecary, which was fascinating enough to make \\nup for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and \\nrotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the \\nfloor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders \\nlined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, \\nand snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While \\nHagrid asked the man behind the counter for a \\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, \\nHarry himself examined silver unicorn horns at \\ntwenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- \\nblack beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list \\nagain. \\n\\n“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got \\nyeh a birthday present.” \\n\\nHarry felt himself go red. \\n\\n“You don’t have to — ” \\n\\n“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer \\nanimal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years \\nago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they \\nmake me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want \\nowls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ \\neverythin’.” \\n\\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl \\nEmporium, which had been dark and full of rustling \\nand flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a \\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep \\nwith her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop \\nstammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor \\nQuirrell. \\n\\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect \\nyou’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just \\nOllivanders left now — only place fer wands, \\nOllivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” \\n\\nA magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really \\nlooking forward to. \\n\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold \\nletters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine \\nWands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded \\npurple cushion in the dusty window. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the \\nshop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, \\nempty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid \\nsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had \\nentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new \\nquestions that had just occurred to him and looked \\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly \\nright up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of \\nhis neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here \\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic. \\n\\n“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. \\nHagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a \\nloud crunching noise and he got quickly off the \\nspindly chair. \\n\\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale \\neyes shining like moons through the gloom of the \\nshop. \\n\\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. \\n\\n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be \\nseeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. \\n“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday \\nshe was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten \\nand a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. \\nNice wand for charm work.” \\n\\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished \\nhe would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \\n\\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany \\nwand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and \\nexcellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father \\nfavored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the \\nwizard, of course.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry \\nwere almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself \\nreflected in those misty eyes. \\n\\n“And that’s where ...” \\n\\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s \\nforehead with a long, white finger. \\n\\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said \\nsoftly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful \\nwand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, \\nif I’d known what that wand was going out into the \\nworld to do. ...” \\n\\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted \\nHagrid. \\n\\n“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. \\n\\n... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” \\n\\n“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid. \\n\\n“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it \\nin half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, \\nsuddenly stern. \\n\\n“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his \\nfeet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added \\nbrightly. \\n\\n“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander \\nsharply. \\n\\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he \\ngripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \\n\\n“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a \\npiercing look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe pulled a long tape measure with silver markings \\nout of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” \\n\\n“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry \\nfrom shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder \\nto floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he \\nmeasured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core \\nof a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use \\nunicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the \\nheartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are \\nthe same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or \\nphoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will \\nnever get such good results with another wizard’s \\nwand.” \\n\\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which \\nwas measuring between his nostrils, was doing this \\non its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the \\nshelves, taking down boxes. \\n\\n“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure \\ncrumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. \\nPotter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon \\nheartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take \\nit and give it a wave.” \\n\\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it \\naround a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his \\nhand almost at once. \\n\\n“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite \\nwhippy. Try — ” \\n\\nHarry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand \\nwhen it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a \\nhalf inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” \\n\\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. \\nOllivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands \\nwas mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, \\nbut the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the \\nshelves, the happier he seemed to become. \\n\\n“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the \\nperfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — \\nyes, why not — unusual combination — holly and \\nphoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” \\n\\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his \\nfingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it \\nswishing down through the dusty air and a stream of \\nred and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, \\nthrowing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid \\nwhooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, \\nbravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... \\nhow curious ... how very curious ...” \\n\\nHe put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it \\nin brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious \\n\\n\\n\\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” \\n\\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \\n\\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. \\nEvery single wand. It so happens that the phoenix \\nwhose tail feather is in your wand, gave another \\nfeather — just one other. It is very curious indeed \\nthat you should be destined for this wand when its \\nbrother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry swallowed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed \\nhow these things happen. The wand chooses the \\nwizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great \\nthings from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who- \\nMust-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, \\nbut great.” \\n\\nHarry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. \\n\\nOllivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for \\nhis wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his \\nshop. \\n\\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry \\nand Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, \\nback through the wall, back through the Leaky \\nCauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as \\nthey walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how \\nmuch people were gawking at them on the \\nUnderground, laden as they were with all their funny- \\nshaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its \\ncage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into \\nPaddington station; Harry only realized where they \\nwere when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \\n\\n“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he \\nsaid. \\n\\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on \\nplastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. \\nEverything looked so strange, somehow. \\n\\n“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. \\n\\nHarry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the \\nbest birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his \\nhamburger, trying to find the words. \\n\\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All \\nthose people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything \\nabout magic at all. How can they expect great things? \\nI’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m \\nfamous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, \\nsorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” \\n\\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard \\nand eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \\n\\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. \\nEveryone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll \\nbe just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve \\nbeen singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll \\nhave a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, \\n’smatter of fact.” \\n\\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take \\nhim back to the Dursleys, then handed him an \\nenvelope. \\n\\n“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September \\n— King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems \\nwith the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll \\nknow where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.” \\n\\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to \\nwatch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his \\nseat and pressed his nose against the window, but he \\nblinked and Hagrid had gone. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM \\nNINE AND THREE-QUARTERS \\n\\nHarry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. \\nTrue, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t \\nstay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle \\nVernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him \\nto do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t \\nspeak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they \\nacted as though any chair with Harry in it were \\nempty. Although this was an improvement in many \\nways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. \\n\\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for \\ncompany. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name \\nhe had found in A History of Magic. His school books \\nwere very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late \\ninto the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the \\nopen window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt \\nPetunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because \\nHedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night \\nbefore he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\non the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, \\ncounting down to September the first. \\n\\nOn the last day of August he thought he’d better \\nspeak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s \\nCross station the next day, so he went down to the \\nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on \\ntelevision. He cleared his throat to let them know he \\nwas there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the \\nroom. \\n\\n“Er — Uncle Vernon?” \\n\\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \\n\\n“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to \\ngo to Hogwarts.” \\n\\nUncle Vernon grunted again. \\n\\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” \\n\\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \\n\\n“Thank you.” \\n\\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon \\nactually spoke. \\n\\n“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. \\nMagic carpets all got punctures, have they?” \\n\\nHarry didn’t say anything. \\n\\n“Where is this school, anyway?” \\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first \\ntime. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of \\nhis pocket. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I just take the train from platform nine and three- \\nquarters at eleven o’clock,” he read. \\n\\nHis aunt and uncle stared. \\n\\n“Platform what?” \\n\\n“Nine and three-quarters.” \\n\\n“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no \\nplatform nine and three-quarters.” \\n\\n“It’s on my ticket.” \\n\\n“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of \\nthem. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take \\nyou to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London \\ntomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” \\n\\n“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying \\nto keep things friendly. \\n\\n“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle \\nVernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before \\nhe goes to Smeltings.” \\n\\nHarry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was \\ntoo excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up \\nand pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to \\nwalk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d \\nchange on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet \\nagain to make sure he had everything he needed, saw \\nthat Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then \\npaced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. \\nTwo hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been \\nloaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had \\ntalked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had \\nset off. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle \\nVernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and \\nwheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this \\nwas strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, \\nfacing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \\n\\n“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform \\nten. Your platform should be somewhere in the \\nmiddle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do \\nthey?” \\n\\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic \\nnumber nine over one platform and a big plastic \\nnumber ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, \\nnothing at all. \\n\\n“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even \\nnastier smile. He left without another word. Harry \\nturned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of \\nthem were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. \\nWhat on earth was he going to do? He was starting to \\nattract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d \\nhave to ask someone. \\n\\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention \\nplatform nine and three-quarters. The guard had \\nnever heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t \\neven tell him what part of the country it was in, he \\nstarted to get annoyed, as though Harry was being \\nstupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for \\nthe train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said \\nthere wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, \\nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying \\nhard not to panic. According to the large clock over \\nthe arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on \\nthe train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; \\nhe was stranded in the middle of a station with a \\ntrunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard \\nmoney, and a large owl. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you \\nhad to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to \\nget into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get \\nout his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s \\nstand between platforms nine and ten. \\n\\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind \\nhim and he caught a few words of what they were \\nsaying. \\n\\n“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” \\n\\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump \\nwoman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming \\nred hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like \\nHarry’s in front of him — and they had an owl. \\n\\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. \\nThey stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear \\nwhat they were saying. \\n\\n“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ \\nmother. \\n\\n“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red- \\nheaded, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go \\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, \\nPercy, you go first.” \\n\\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward \\nplatforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to \\nblink in case he missed it — but just as the boy \\nreached the dividing barrier between the two \\nplatforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in \\nfront of him and by the time the last backpack had \\ncleared away, the boy had vanished. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, \\nwoman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell \\nI’m George?” \\n\\n“Sorry, George, dear.” \\n\\n“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he \\nwent. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he \\nmust have done so, because a second later, he had \\ngone — but how had he done it? \\n\\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the \\nbarrier — he was almost there — and then, quite \\nsuddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. \\n\\nThere was nothing else for it. \\n\\n“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman. \\n\\n“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s \\nnew, too.” \\n\\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He \\nwas tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands \\nand feet, and a long nose. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t \\nknow how to — ” \\n\\n“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and \\nHarry nodded. \\n\\n“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk \\nstraight at the barrier between platforms nine and \\nten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into \\nit, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if \\nyou’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Er — okay,” said Harry. \\n\\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the \\nbarrier. It looked very solid. \\n\\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on \\ntheir way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked \\nmore quickly. He was going to smash right into that \\nbarrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward \\non his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier \\nwas coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able \\nto stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot \\naway — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — \\n\\nIt didn’t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his \\neyes. \\n\\nA scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform \\npacked with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts \\nExpress, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and \\nsaw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had \\nbeen, with the words Platform Nine and Three- \\nQuarters on it. He had done it. \\n\\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the \\nchattering crowd, while cats of every color wound \\nhere and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one \\nanother in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble \\nand the scraping of heavy trunks. \\n\\nThe first few carriages were already packed with \\nstudents, some hanging out of the window to talk to \\ntheir families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed \\nhis cart off down the platform in search of an empty \\nseat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \\n“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” \\n\\n“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small \\ncrowd. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Give us a look, Lee, go on.” \\n\\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the \\npeople around him shrieked and yelled as something \\ninside poked out a long, hairy leg. \\n\\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found \\nan empty compartment near the end of the train. He \\nput Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and \\nheave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift \\nit up the steps but could hardly raise one end and \\ntwice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \\n\\n“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins \\nhe’d followed through the barrier. \\n\\n“Yes, please,” Harry panted. \\n\\n“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!” \\n\\nWith the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked \\naway in a corner of the compartment. \\n\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of \\nhis eyes. \\n\\n“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, \\npointing at Harry’s lightning scar. \\n\\n“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?” \\n\\n“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to \\nHarry. \\n\\n“What?” said Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ Harry Potter,” chorused the twins. \\n\\n“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.” \\n\\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself \\nturning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating \\nin through the train’s open door. \\n\\n“Fred? George? Are you there?” \\n\\n“Coming, Mom.” \\n\\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the \\ntrain. \\n\\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half \\nhidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the \\nplatform and hear what they were saying. Their \\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief. \\n\\n“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” \\n\\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she \\ngrabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \\n\\n“Mom — geroff.” He wriggled free. \\n\\n“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” \\nsaid one of the twins. \\n\\n“Shut up,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Where’s Percy?” said their mother. \\n\\n“He’s coming now.” \\n\\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had \\nalready changed into his billowing black Hogwarts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrobes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge \\non his chest with the letter P on it. \\n\\n“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the \\nprefects have got two compartments to themselves — ” \\n\\n“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, \\nwith an air of great surprise. “You should have said \\nsomething, we had no idea.” \\n\\n“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something \\nabout it,” said the other twin. “Once — ” \\n\\n“Or twice — ” \\n\\n“A minute — ” \\n\\n“All summer — ” \\n\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. \\n\\n“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one \\nof the twins. \\n\\n“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All \\nright, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl \\nwhen you get there.” \\n\\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she \\nturned to the twins. \\n\\n“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I \\nget one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up \\na toilet or — ” \\n\\n“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” \\n“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” \\n\\n“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” \\n\\n“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as \\nthe twins already and his nose was still pink where \\nhis mother had rubbed it. \\n\\n“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on \\nthe train?” \\n\\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him \\nlooking. \\n\\n“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in \\nthe station? Know who he is?” \\n\\n“Who?” \\n\\n“ Harry Potted” \\n\\nHarry heard the little girl’s voice. \\n\\n“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, \\noh please. ...” \\n\\n“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy \\nisn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, \\nFred? How do you know?” \\n\\n“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like \\nlightning.” \\n\\n“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He \\nwas ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the \\nplatform.” \\n\\n“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what \\nYou-Know-Who looks like?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As \\nthough he needs reminding of that on his first day at \\nschool.” \\n\\n“All right, keep your hair on.” \\n\\nA whistle sounded. \\n\\n“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys \\nclambered onto the train. They leaned out of the \\nwindow for her to kiss them good-bye, and their \\nyounger sister began to cry. \\n\\n“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” \\n\\n“Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” \\n\\n“ Georg e\\\\” \\n\\n“Only joking, Mom.” \\n\\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother \\nwaving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, \\nrunning to keep up with the train until it gathered too \\nmuch speed, then she fell back and waved. \\n\\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as \\nthe train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the \\nwindow. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He \\ndidn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be \\nbetter than what he was leaving behind. \\n\\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the \\nyoungest redheaded boy came in. \\n\\n“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat \\nopposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He \\nglanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the \\nwindow, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he \\nstill had a black mark on his nose. \\n\\n“Hey, Ron.” \\n\\nThe twins were back. \\n\\n“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — \\n\\nLee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” \\n\\n“Right,” mumbled Ron. \\n\\n“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce \\nourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, \\nour brother. See you later, then.” \\n\\n“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the \\ncompartment door shut behind them. \\n\\n“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. \\n\\nHarry nodded. \\n\\n“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and \\nGeorge’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — \\nyou know ...” \\n\\nHe pointed at Harry’s forehead. \\n\\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning \\nscar. Ron stared. \\n\\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” \\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” \\n\\n“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing \\nelse.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few \\nmoments, then, as though he had suddenly realized \\nwhat he was doing, he looked quickly out of the \\nwindow again. \\n\\n“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found \\nRon just as interesting as Ron found him. \\n\\n“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a \\nsecond cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk \\nabout him.” \\n\\n“So you must know loads of magic already.” \\n\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding \\nfamilies the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked \\nabout. \\n\\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. \\n“What are they like?” \\n\\n“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle \\nand cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard \\nbrothers.” \\n\\n“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking \\ngloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. \\nYou could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and \\nCharlie have already left — Bill was head boy and \\nCharlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a \\nprefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they \\nstill get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re \\nreally funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the \\nothers, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it \\nfirst. You never get anything new, either, with five \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbrothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, \\nand Percy’s old rat.” \\n\\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat \\ngray rat, which was asleep. \\n\\n“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever \\nwakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being \\nmade a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got \\nScabbers instead.” \\n\\nRon’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said \\ntoo much, because he went back to staring out of the \\nwindow. \\n\\nHarry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not \\nbeing able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had \\nany money in his life until a month ago, and he told \\nRon so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes \\nand never getting proper birthday presents. This \\nseemed to cheer Ron up. \\n\\n\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything \\nabout being a wizard or about my parents or \\nVoldemort — ” \\n\\nRon gasped. \\n\\n“What?” said Harry. \\n\\n“ You said You-Know-Who’s name\\\\” said Ron, sounding \\nboth shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, \\nof all people — ” \\n\\n“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the \\nname,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. \\nSee what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,” he \\nadded, voicing for the first time something that had \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbeen worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in \\nthe class.” \\n\\n“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from \\nMuggle families and they learn quick enough.” \\n\\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried \\nthem out of London. Now they were speeding past \\nfields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a \\ntime, watching the fields and lanes flick past. \\n\\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering \\noutside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman \\nslid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, \\ndears?” \\n\\nHarry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, \\nbut Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that \\nhe’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the \\ncorridor. \\n\\nHe had never had any money for candy with the \\nDursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with \\ngold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars \\nBars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have \\nMars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s \\nEvery Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, \\nChocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, \\nLicorice Wands, and a number of other strange things \\nHarry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss \\nanything, he got some of everything and paid the \\nwoman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. \\n\\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the \\ncompartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \\n\\n“Hungry, are you?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a \\npumpkin pasty. \\n\\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped \\nit. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one \\nof them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t \\nlike corned beef.” \\n\\n“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a \\npasty. “Go on — ” \\n\\n“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She \\nhasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, \\nwith five of us.” \\n\\n“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had \\nanything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share \\nit with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, \\neating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, \\nand candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \\n\\n“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a \\npack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are \\nthey?” He was starting to feel that nothing would \\nsurprise him. \\n\\n“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing \\nAgrippa.” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs \\nhave cards inside them, you know, to collect — \\nfamous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five \\nhundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” \\n\\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up \\nthe card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon \\nglasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture \\nwas the name Albus Dumbledore. \\n\\n\\n\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry. \\n\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said \\nRon. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry turned over his card and read: \\n\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE \\n\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS \\n\\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern \\ntimes, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his \\ndefeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the \\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his \\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. \\nProfessor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten \\npin bowling. \\n\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his \\nastonishment, that Dumbledore ’s face had \\ndisappeared. \\n\\n“He’s gone!” \\n\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” \\nsaid Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again \\nand I’ve got about six of her ... do you want it? You \\ncan start collecting.” \\n\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs \\nwaiting to be unwrapped. \\n\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the \\nMuggle world, people just stay put in photos.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded \\namazed. “Weird).” \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the \\npicture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron \\nwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking \\nat the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry \\ncouldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only \\nDumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, \\nAlberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He \\nfinally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, \\nwho was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie \\nBott’s Every Flavor Beans. \\n\\n“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned \\nHarry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every \\nflavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like \\nchocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then \\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe. George \\nreckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” \\n\\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, \\nand bit into a corner. \\n\\n“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.” \\n\\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. \\nHarry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, \\ncurry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave \\nenough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron \\nwouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. \\n\\nThe countryside now flying past the window was \\nbecoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there \\nwere woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. \\n\\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment \\nand the round-faced boy Harry had passed on \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplatform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked \\ntearful. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” \\n\\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost \\nhim! He keeps getting away from me!” \\n\\n“Hell turn up,” said Harry. \\n\\n“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him ...” \\nHe left. \\n\\n“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d \\nbrought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind \\nyou, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” \\n\\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap. \\n\\n“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the \\ndifference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him \\nyellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but \\nthe spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look ...” \\n\\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a \\nvery battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places \\nand something white was glinting at the end. \\n\\n“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway — ” \\n\\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment \\ndoor slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but \\nthis time he had a girl with him. She was already \\nwearing her new Hogwarts robes. \\n\\n“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. \\nShe had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown \\nhair, and rather large front teeth. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, \\nbut the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the \\nwand in his hand. \\n\\n“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” \\n\\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \\n\\n“Er — all right.” \\n\\nHe cleared his throat. \\n\\n“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, \\n\\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” \\n\\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers \\nstayed gray and fast asleep. \\n\\n“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, \\nit’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells \\njust for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in \\nmy family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise \\nwhen I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of \\ncourse, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft \\nthere is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books \\nby heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m \\nHermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” \\n\\nShe said all this very fast. \\n\\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his \\nstunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course \\nbooks by heart either. \\n\\n“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered. \\n\\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about \\nyou, of course — I got a few extra books for \\nbackground reading, and you’re in Modern Magical \\nHistory and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and \\nGreat Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” \\n\\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed. \\n\\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out \\neverything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do \\neither of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been \\nasking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds \\nby far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, \\nbut I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ... \\nAnyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. \\n\\nYou two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll \\nbe there soon.” \\n\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \\n\\n“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said \\nRon. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid \\nspell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a \\ndud.” \\n\\n“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry. \\n\\n“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling \\non him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t \\nknow what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose \\nRavenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put \\nme in Slytherin.” \\n\\n“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was \\nin?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, \\nlooking depressed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are \\na bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off \\nHouses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that \\nthey’ve left, anyway?” \\n\\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d \\nfinished school. \\n\\n“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in \\nAfrica doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did \\nyou hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily \\nProphet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the \\nMuggles — someone tried to rob a high security \\nvault.” \\n\\nHarry stared. \\n\\n“Really? What happened to them?” \\n\\n“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t \\nbeen caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful \\nDark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t \\nthink they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, \\neveryone gets scared when something like this \\nhappens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” \\n\\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was \\nstarting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- \\nWho was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of \\nentering the magical world, but it had been a lot more \\ncomfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying. \\n\\n“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked. \\n\\n“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed. \\n\\n“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s \\nthe best game in the world — ” And he was off, \\nexplaining all about the four balls and the positions of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe seven players, describing famous games he’d been \\nto with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to \\nget if he had the money. He was just taking Harry \\nthrough the finer points of the game when the \\ncompartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t \\nNeville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this \\ntime. \\n\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle \\none at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s \\nrobe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more \\ninterest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley. \\n\\n“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train \\nthat Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is \\nit?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. \\nBoth of them were thickset and looked extremely \\nmean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they \\nlooked like bodyguards. \\n\\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale \\nboy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \\n\\n“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” \\n\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been \\nhiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \\n\\n“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who \\nyou are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red \\nhair, freckles, and more children than they can \\nafford.” \\n\\nHe turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some \\nwizarding families are much better than others, \\n\\nPotter. You don’t want to go making friends with the \\nwrong sort. I can help you there.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry \\ndidn’t take it. \\n\\n“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, \\nthanks,” he said coolly. \\n\\nDraco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared \\nin his pale cheeks. \\n\\n“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. \\n“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as \\nyour parents. They didn’t know what was good for \\nthem, either. You hang around with riffraff like the \\nWeasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” \\n\\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up. \\n\\n“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \\n\\n“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy \\nsneered. \\n\\n“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely \\nthan he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot \\nbigger than him or Ron. \\n\\n“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve \\neaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” \\n\\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to \\nRon — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as \\ntouched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. \\n\\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp \\nlittle teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe \\nand Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers \\nround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally \\nflew off and hit the window, all three of them \\ndisappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmore rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps \\nthey’d heard footsteps, because a second later, \\nHermione Granger had come in. \\n\\n“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the \\nsweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers \\nby his tail. \\n\\n“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. \\n\\nHe looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it \\n— he’s gone back to sleep.” \\n\\nAnd so he had. \\n\\n“You’ve met Malfoy before?” \\n\\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \\n\\n“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were \\nsome of the first to come back to our side after You- \\nKnow-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. \\nMy dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father \\ndidn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He \\nturned to Hermione. “Can we help you with \\nsomething?” \\n\\n“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve \\njust been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he \\nsays we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, \\nhave you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get \\nthere!” \\n\\n“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, \\nscowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we \\nchange?” \\n\\n“All right — I only came in here because people \\noutside are behaving very childishly, racing up and \\ndown the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you \\nknow?” \\n\\n\\n\\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the \\nwindow. It was getting dark. He could see mountains \\nand forests under a deep purple sky. The train did \\nseem to be slowing down. \\n\\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their \\nlong black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you \\ncould see his sneakers underneath them. \\n\\nA voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching \\nHogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your \\nluggage on the train, it will be taken to the school \\nseparately.” \\n\\nHarry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he \\nsaw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed \\ntheir pockets with the last of the sweets and joined \\nthe crowd thronging the corridor. \\n\\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. \\nPeople pushed their way toward the door and out on \\nto a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold \\nnight air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads \\nof the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \\n“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, \\nHarry?” \\n\\nHagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \\n\\n“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer \\nstep, now! Firs’ years follow me!” \\n\\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down \\nwhat seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so \\ndark on either side of them that Harry thought there \\nmust be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once \\nor twice. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid \\ncalled over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” \\n\\nThere was a loud “Oooooh!” \\n\\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge \\nof a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain \\non the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry \\nsky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \\n\\n“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to \\na fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. \\nHarry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville \\nand Hermione. \\n\\n“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to \\nhimself. “Right then — FORWARD!” \\n\\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, \\ngliding across the lake, which was as smooth as \\nglass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great \\ncastle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed \\nnearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \\n\\n“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached \\nthe cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats \\ncarried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide \\nopening in the cliff face. They were carried along a \\ndark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right \\nunderneath the castle, until they reached a kind of \\nunderground harbor, where they clambered out onto \\nrocks and pebbles. \\n\\n“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who \\nwas checking the boats as people climbed out of \\nthem. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his \\nhands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the \\nrock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto \\nsmooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. \\n\\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded \\naround the huge, oak front door. \\n\\n“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” \\n\\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times \\non the castle door. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SORTING HAT \\n\\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired \\nwitch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a \\nvery stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this \\nwas not someone to cross. \\n\\n“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid. \\n\\n“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.” \\n\\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so \\nbig you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ \\nhouse in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming \\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too \\nhigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase \\nfacing them led to the upper floors. \\n\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the \\nflagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of \\nhundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the \\nrest of the school must already be here — but \\nProfessor McGonagall showed the first years into a \\nsmall, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, \\n\\n\\n\\nstanding rather closer together than they would \\nusually have done, peering about nervously. \\n\\n“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. \\n“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but \\nbefore you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will \\nbe sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very \\nimportant ceremony because, while you are here, \\nyour House will be something like your family within \\nHogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your \\nHouse, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free \\ntime in your House common room. \\n\\n“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, \\nRavenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own \\nnoble history and each has produced outstanding \\nwitches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your \\ntriumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- \\nbreaking will lose House points. At the end of the \\nyear, the House with the most points is awarded the \\nHouse cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a \\ncredit to whichever House becomes yours. \\n\\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few \\nminutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest \\nyou all smarten yourselves up as much as you can \\nwhile you are waiting.” \\n\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, \\nwhich was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s \\nsmudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his \\nhair. \\n\\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said \\nProfessor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” \\n\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked \\nRon. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but \\nI think he was joking.” \\n\\nHarry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of \\nthe whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet \\n— what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t \\nexpected something like this the moment they \\narrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that \\neveryone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking \\nmuch except Hermione Granger, who was whispering \\nvery fast about all the spells she’d learned and \\nwondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not \\nto listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, \\nnot even when he’d had to take a school report home \\nto the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his \\nteachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. \\nAny second now, Professor McGonagall would come \\nback and lead him to his doom. \\n\\nThen something happened that made him jump about \\na foot in the air — several people behind him \\nscreamed. \\n\\n“What the — ?” \\n\\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About \\ntwenty ghosts had just streamed through the back \\nwall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they \\nglided across the room talking to one another and \\nhardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be \\narguing. What looked like a fat little monk was \\nsaying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give \\nhim a second chance — ” \\n\\n“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the \\nchances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what \\nare you all doing here?” \\n\\n\\n\\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly \\nnoticed the first years. \\n\\nNobody answered. \\n\\n“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at \\nthem. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?” \\n\\nA few people nodded mutely. \\n\\n“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old \\nHouse, you know.” \\n\\n“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting \\nCeremony’s about to start.” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the \\nghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \\n\\n“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first \\nyears, “and follow me.” \\n\\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, \\nHarry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with \\nRon behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, \\nback across the hall, and through a pair of double \\ndoors into the Great Hall. \\n\\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and \\nsplendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands \\nof candles that were floating in midair over four long \\ntables, where the rest of the students were sitting. \\nThese tables were laid with glittering golden plates \\nand goblets. At the top of the hall was another long \\ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor \\nMcGonagall led the first years up here, so that they \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncame to a halt in a line facing the other students, \\nwith the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces \\nstaring at them looked like pale lanterns in the \\nflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among \\nthe students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to \\navoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and \\nsaw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard \\nHermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky \\noutside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.” \\n\\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, \\nand that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the \\nheavens. \\n\\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor \\nMcGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front \\nof the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed \\nwizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and \\nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in \\nthe house. \\n\\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry \\nthought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — \\nnoticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at \\nthe hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there \\nwas complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip \\nnear the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the \\nhat began to sing: \\n\\n“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, \\n\\nBut don’t judge on what you see, \\n\\nI’ll eat myself if you can find \\n\\nA smarter hat than me. \\n\\nYou can keep your bowlers black, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour top hats sleek and tall, \\n\\nFor I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat \\nAnd I can cap them all. \\n\\nThere’s nothing hidden in your head \\nThe Sorting Hat can’t see, \\n\\nSo try me on and I will tell you \\nWhere you ought to be. \\n\\nYou might belong in Gryffindor, \\n\\nWhere dwell the brave at heart, \\n\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry \\nSet Gryffindors apart; \\n\\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff, \\n\\nWhere they are just and loyal, \\n\\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true \\nAnd unafraid of toil; \\n\\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw, \\n\\nIf you’ve a ready mind, \\n\\nWhere those of wit and learning, \\n\\nWill always find their kind; \\n\\nOr perhaps in Slytherin \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’ll make your real friends, \\n\\nThose cunning folk use any means \\nTo achieve their ends. \\n\\nSo put me on! Don’t be afraid l\\\\ \\n\\nAnd don’t get in a flap\\\\ \\n\\nYou’re in safe hands (though I have none) \\n\\nFor I’m a Thinking Cap\\\\” \\n\\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished \\nits song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then \\nbecame quite still again. \\n\\n“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to \\nHarry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling \\na troll.” \\n\\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot \\nbetter than having to do a spell, but he did wish they \\ncould have tried it on without everyone watching. The \\nhat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel \\nbrave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If \\nonly the hat had mentioned a House for people who \\nfelt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for \\nhim. \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a \\nlong roll of parchment. \\n\\n“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and \\nsit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, \\nHannah!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of \\nline, put on the hat, which fell right down over her \\neyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause — \\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat. \\n\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as \\nHannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. \\n\\nHarry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at \\nher. \\n\\n“Bones, Susan!” \\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan \\nscuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \\n\\n“Boot, Terry!” \\n\\n“RAVENCLAW!” \\n\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; \\nseveral Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with \\nTerry as he joined them. \\n\\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but \\n“Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, \\nand the table on the far left exploded with cheers; \\nHarry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling. \\n\\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. \\nPerhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d \\nheard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked \\nlike an unpleasant lot. \\n\\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He \\nremembered being picked for teams during gym at his \\nold school. He had always been last to be chosen, not \\nbecause he was no good, but because no one wanted \\nDudley to think they liked him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” \\n\\n\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” \\n\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the \\nHouse at once, but at others it took a little while to \\ndecide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy \\nnext to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a \\nwhole minute before the hat declared him a \\nGryffindor. \\n\\n“Granger, Hermione!” \\n\\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat \\neagerly on her head. \\n\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned. \\n\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts \\nalways do when you’re very nervous. What if he \\nwasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with \\nthe hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor \\nMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had \\nobviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on \\nthe train? \\n\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his \\ntoad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. \\nThe hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When \\nit finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still \\nwearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter \\nto give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” \\n\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called \\nand got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched \\nhis head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” \\n\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, \\nlooking pleased with himself. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere weren’t many people left now. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Moon” , “Nott” ... , “Parkinson” ... , then a pair of \\ntwin girls, “Path” and “Path” ... , then “Perks, Sally- \\nAnne” . . . , and then, at last — \\n\\n“Potter, Harry!” \\n\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke \\nout like little hissing fires all over the hall. \\n\\n“ Potter , did she say?” \\n\\n“ The Harry Potter?” \\n\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over \\nhis eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a \\ngood look at him. Next second he was looking at the \\nblack inside of the hat. He waited. \\n\\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very \\ndifficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind \\neither. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a \\nnice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ... \\nSo where shall I put you?” \\n\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not \\nSlytherin, not Slytherin. \\n\\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you \\nsure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in \\nyour head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to \\ngreatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re \\nsure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” \\n\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole \\nhall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward \\nthe Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been \\nchosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the \\nPrefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while \\nthe Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got \\nPotter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff \\nhe’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving \\nHarry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it \\ninto a bucket of ice-cold water. \\n\\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end \\nnearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave \\nhim the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, \\nin the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, \\nsat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once \\nfrom the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on \\nthe train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing \\nin the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. \\nHarry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous \\nyoung man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking \\nvery peculiar in a large purple turban. \\n\\nAnd now there were only four people left to be sorted. \\n“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, \\njoined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” \\nbecame a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He \\nwas pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers \\nunder the table and a second later the hat had \\nshouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” \\n\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed \\ninto the chair next to him. \\n\\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley \\npompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was \\nmade a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her \\nscroll and took the Sorting Hat away. \\n\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had \\nonly just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin \\npasties seemed ages ago. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was \\nbeaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if \\nnothing could have pleased him more than to see \\nthem all there. \\n\\n“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at \\nHogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like \\nto say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! \\n\\nBlubber! Oddment! Tweak! \\n\\n“Thank you!” \\n\\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. \\nHarry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. \\n\\n“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly. \\n\\n“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard \\nin the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, \\nHarry?” \\n\\nHarry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him \\nwere now piled with food. He had never seen so many \\nthings he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast \\nchicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, \\nbacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, \\nfries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, \\nketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint \\nhumbugs. \\n\\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but \\nhe’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. \\nDudley had always taken anything that Harry really \\nwanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate \\nwith a bit of everything except the peppermints and \\nbegan to eat. It was all delicious. \\n\\n“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, \\nwatching Harry cut up his steak. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can’t you — ?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said \\nthe ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does \\nmiss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir \\nNicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. \\nResident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” \\n\\n“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My \\nbrothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless \\nNick!” \\n\\n“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\n— ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus \\nFinnigan interrupted. \\n\\n“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?” \\n\\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little \\nchat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted. \\n\\n“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and \\npulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell \\nonto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone \\nhad obviously tried to behead him, but not done it \\nproperly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on \\ntheir faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head \\nback onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new \\nGryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the \\nHouse Championship this year? Gryffindors have \\nnever gone so long without winning. Slytherins have \\ngot the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s \\nbecoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin \\nghost.” \\n\\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a \\nhorrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a \\ngaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He \\nwas right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsee, didn’t look too pleased with the seating \\narrangements. \\n\\n“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus \\nwith great interest. \\n\\n“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick \\ndelicately. \\n\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the \\nremains of the food faded from the plates, leaving \\nthem sparkling clean as before. A moment later the \\ndesserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor \\nyou could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate \\neclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- \\n0, rice pudding ... \\n\\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk \\nturned to their families. \\n\\n“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. \\nMom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they \\nwere married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.” \\n\\nThe others laughed. \\n\\n“What about you, Neville?” said Ron. \\n\\n“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” \\nsaid Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle \\nfor ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me \\noff my guard and force some magic out of me — he \\npushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly \\ndrowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. \\nGreat Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was \\nhanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles \\nwhen my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue \\nand he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the \\nway down the garden and into the road. They were all \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreally pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. \\nAnd you should have seen their faces when I got in \\nhere — they thought I might not be magic enough to \\ncome, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he \\nbought me my toad.” \\n\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione \\nwere talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right \\naway, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly \\ninterested in Transfiguration, you know, turning \\nsomething into something else, of course, it’s \\nsupposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting \\nsmall, just matches into needles and that sort of \\nthing — ”). \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, \\nlooked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was \\ndrinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall \\nwas talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor \\nQuirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a \\nteacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and \\nsallow skin. \\n\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher \\nlooked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s \\neyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on \\nHarry’s forehead. \\n\\n“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head. \\n\\n“What is it?” asked Percy. \\n\\n“N-nothing.” \\n\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder \\nto shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the \\nteacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at \\nall. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he \\nasked Percy. \\n\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder \\nhe’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He \\nteaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone \\nknows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot \\nabout the Dark Arts, Snape.” \\n\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t \\nlook at him again. \\n\\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor \\nDumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \\n\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all \\nfed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to \\ngive you. \\n\\n“First years should note that the forest on the \\ngrounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our \\nolder students would do well to remember that as \\nwell.” \\n\\nDumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction \\nof the Weasley twins. \\n\\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to \\nremind you all that no magic should be used between \\nclasses in the corridors. \\n\\n“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of \\nthe term. Anyone interested in playing for their House \\nteams should contact Madam Hooch. \\n\\n“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- \\nfloor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds \\nto everyone who does not wish to die a very painful \\ndeath.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \\n\\n\\n\\n“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy. \\n\\n“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s \\nodd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re \\nnot allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of \\ndangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he \\nmight have told us prefects, at least.” \\n\\n“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school \\nsong!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other \\nteachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. \\n\\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was \\ntrying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden \\nribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables \\nand twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \\n\\n“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, \\n“and off we go!” \\n\\nAnd the school bellowed: \\n\\n“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, \\n\\nTeach us something please, \\n\\nWhether we be old and bald \\nOr young with scabby knees, \\n\\nOur heads could do with filling \\nWith some interesting stuff, \\n\\nFor now they’re bare and full of air, \\n\\nDead flies and bits of fluff, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo teach us things worth knowing, \\n\\nBring back what we’ve forgot, \\n\\nJust do your best, we’ll do the rest, \\n\\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.” \\n\\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, \\nonly the Weasley twins were left singing along to a \\nvery slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their \\nlast few lines with his wand and when they had \\nfinished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \\n\\n“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic \\nbeyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you \\ntrot!” \\n\\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the \\nchattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the \\nmarble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, \\nbut only because he was so tired and full of food. He \\nwas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in \\nthe portraits along the corridors whispered and \\npointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them \\nthrough doorways hidden behind sliding panels and \\nhanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, \\nyawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just \\nwondering how much farther they had to go when \\nthey came to a sudden halt. \\n\\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair \\nahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them \\nthey started throwing themselves at him. \\n\\n“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A \\npoltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show \\nyourself.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a \\nballoon, answered. \\n\\n“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” \\n\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark \\neyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- \\nlegged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \\n\\n“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle \\nFirsties! What fun!” \\n\\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \\n\\n“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I \\nmean it!” barked Percy. \\n\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping \\nthe walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him \\nzooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \\n\\n“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as \\nthey set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one \\nwho can control him, he won’t even listen to us \\nprefects. Here we are.” \\n\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a \\nvery fat woman in a pink silk dress. \\n\\n“Password?” she said. \\n\\n“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung \\nforward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all \\nscrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — \\nand found themselves in the Gryffindor common \\nroom, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. \\n\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their \\ndormitory and the boys through another. At the top of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the \\ntowers — they found their beds at last: five four- \\nposters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their \\ntrunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk \\nmuch, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \\n\\n“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through \\nthe hangings. “Get off Scabbers! He’s chewing my \\nsheets.” \\n\\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the \\ntreacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. \\n\\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he \\nhad a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor \\nQuirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling \\nhim he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it \\nwas his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want \\nto be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried \\nto pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there \\nwas Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — \\nthen Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, \\nSnape, whose laugh became high and cold — there \\nwas a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating \\nand shaking. \\n\\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he \\nwoke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER \\n\\n“There, look.” \\n\\n“Where?” \\n\\n“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” \\n\\n“Wearing the glasses?” \\n\\n“Did you see his face?” \\n\\n“Did you see his scar?” \\n\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his \\ndormitory the next day. People lining up outside \\nclassrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or \\ndoubled back to pass him in the corridors again, \\nstaring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was \\ntrying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. \\n\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at \\nHogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; \\nsome that led somewhere different on a Friday; some \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith a vanishing step halfway up that you had to \\nremember to jump. Then there were doors that \\nwouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled \\nthem in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t \\nreally doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It \\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was, \\nbecause it all seemed to move around a lot. The \\npeople in the portraits kept going to visit each other, \\nand Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. \\n\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty \\nshock when one of them glided suddenly through a \\ndoor you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick \\nwas always happy to point new Gryffindors in the \\nright direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth \\ntwo locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him \\nwhen you were late for class. He would drop \\nwastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from \\nunder your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak \\nup behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \\n“GOT YOUR CONK!” \\n\\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the \\ncaretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get \\non the wrong side of him on their very first morning. \\nFilch found them trying to force their way through a \\ndoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to \\nthe out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He \\nwouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were \\ntrying to break into it on purpose, and was \\nthreatening to lock them in the dungeons when they \\nwere rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. \\n\\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- \\ncolored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like \\nFilch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule \\nin front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d \\nwhisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two \\nseconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe school better than anyone (except perhaps the \\nWeasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any \\nof the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was \\nthe dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a \\ngood kick. \\n\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there \\nwere the classes themselves. There was a lot more to \\nmagic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your \\nwand and saying a few funny words. \\n\\nThey had to study the night skies through their \\ntelescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn \\nthe names of different stars and the movements of the \\nplanets. Three times a week they went out to the \\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, \\nwith a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, \\nwhere they learned how to take care of all the strange \\nplants and fungi, and found out what they were used \\nfor. \\n\\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, \\nwhich was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor \\nBinns had been very old indeed when he had fallen \\nasleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next \\nmorning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns \\ndroned on and on while they scribbled down names \\nand dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the \\nOddball mixed up. \\n\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny \\nlittle wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to \\nsee over his desk. At the start of their first class he \\ntook the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name \\nhe gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had \\nbeen quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to \\nthe moment they sat down in her first class. \\n\\n“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and \\ndangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she \\nsaid. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave \\nand not come back. You have been warned.” \\n\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. \\nThey were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get \\nstarted, but soon realized they weren’t going to be \\nchanging the furniture into animals for a long time. \\nAfter taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each \\ngiven a match and started trying to turn it into a \\nneedle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione \\nGranger had made any difference to her match; \\nProfessor McGonagall showed the class how it had \\ngone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare \\nsmile. \\n\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to \\nwas Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s \\nlessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom \\nsmelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to \\nward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was \\nafraid would be coming back to get him one of these \\ndays. His turban, he told them, had been given to him \\nby an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of \\na troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they \\nbelieved this story. For one thing, when Seamus \\nFinnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had \\nfought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started \\ntalking about the weather; for another, they had \\nnoticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, \\nand the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full \\nof garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected \\nwherever he went. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t \\nmiles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come \\nfrom Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any \\nidea that they were witches and wizards. There was so \\nmuch to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have \\nmuch of a head start. \\n\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They \\nfinally managed to find their way down to the Great \\nHall for breakfast without getting lost once. \\n\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he \\npoured sugar on his porridge. \\n\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. \\n“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always \\nfavors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” \\n\\n“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor \\nMcGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it \\nhadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of \\nhomework the day before. \\n\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to \\nthis by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on \\nthe first morning, when about a hundred owls had \\nsuddenly streamed into the Great Hall during \\nbreakfast, circling the tables until they saw their \\nowners, and dropping letters and packages onto their \\nlaps. \\n\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She \\nsometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of \\ntoast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the \\nother school owls. This morning, however, she \\nfluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar \\nbowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry \\ntore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDear Harry, \\n\\n\\n\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like \\nto come and have a cup of tea with me around three? \\n\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an \\nanswer back with Hedwig. \\n\\nHagrid \\n\\nHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see \\nyou later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off \\nagain. \\n\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look \\nforward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to \\nbe the worst thing that had happened to him so far. \\n\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the \\nidea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of \\nthe first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. \\nSnape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him. \\n\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the \\ndungeons. It was colder here than up in the main \\ncastle, and would have been quite creepy enough \\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all \\naround the walls. \\n\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the \\nroll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name. \\n\\n“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — \\ncelebrity.” \\n\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle \\nsniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling \\nthe names and looked up at the class. His eyes were \\nblack like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwarmth. They were cold and empty and made you \\nthink of dark tunnels. \\n\\n“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art \\nof potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more \\nthan a whisper, but they caught every word — like \\nProfessor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a \\nclass silent without effort. “As there is little foolish \\nwand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe \\nthis is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand \\nthe beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its \\nshimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that \\ncreep through human veins, bewitching the mind, \\nensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle \\nfame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t \\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to \\nteach.” \\n\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and \\nRon exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione \\nGranger was on the edge of her seat and looked \\ndesperate to start proving that she wasn’t a \\ndunderhead. \\n\\n“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I \\nadded powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of \\nwormwood?” \\n\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry \\nglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; \\nHermione ’s hand had shot into the air. \\n\\n“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. \\n\\nSnape ’s lips curled into a sneer. \\n\\n“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” \\n\\nHe ignored Hermione ’s hand. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told \\nyou to find me a bezoar?” \\n\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it \\nwould go without her leaving her seat, but Harry \\ndidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He \\ntried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who \\nwere shaking with laughter. \\n\\n“I don’t know, sir.” \\n\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, \\neh, Potter?” \\n\\nHarry forced himself to keep looking straight into \\nthose cold eyes. He had looked through his books at \\nthe Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember \\neverything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and \\nFungi ? \\n\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand. \\n\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood \\nand wolfsbane?” \\n\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching \\ntoward the dungeon ceiling. \\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione \\ndoes, though, why don’t you try her?” \\n\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, \\nand Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not \\npleased. \\n\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your \\ninformation, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a \\nsleeping potion so powerful it is known as the \\nDraught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the stomach of a goat and it will save you from \\nmost poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they \\nare the same plant, which also goes by the name of \\naconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?” \\n\\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and \\nparchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point \\nwill be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, \\nPotter.” \\n\\nThings didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the \\nPotions lesson continued. Snape put them all into \\npairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to \\ncure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, \\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake \\nfangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, \\nwhom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone \\nto look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his \\nhorned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a \\nloud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow \\nmanaged to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted \\nblob, and their potion was seeping across the stone \\nfloor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within \\nseconds, the whole class was standing on their stools \\nwhile Neville, who had been drenched in the potion \\nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as \\nangry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \\n\\n“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion \\naway with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you \\nadded the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron \\noff the fire?” \\n\\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over \\nhis nose. \\n\\n“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at \\nSeamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who \\nhad been working next to Neville. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add \\nthe quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got \\nit wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for \\nGryffindor.” \\n\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to \\nargue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \\n\\n“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can \\nturn very nasty.” \\n\\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour \\nlater, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were \\nlow. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very \\nfirst week — why did Snape hate him so much? \\n\\n“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points \\noff Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid \\nwith you?” \\n\\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way \\nacross the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden \\nhouse on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow \\nand a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. \\n\\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling \\nfrom inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid ’s \\nvoice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” \\n\\nHagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he \\npulled the door open. \\n\\n“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.” \\n\\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar \\nof an enormous black boarhound. \\n\\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants \\nwere hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nboiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a \\nmassive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \\n\\n“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of \\nFang, who bounded straight at Ron and started \\nlicking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as \\nfierce as he looked. \\n\\n“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring \\nboiling water into a large teapot and putting rock \\ncakes onto a plate. \\n\\n“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s \\nfreckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers \\naway from the forest.” \\n\\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins \\nthat almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron \\npretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all \\nabout their first lessons. Fang rested his head on \\nHarry’s knee and drooled all over his robes. \\n\\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call \\nFilch “that old git.” \\n\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce \\nher to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up \\nter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get \\nrid of her — Filch puts her up to it.” \\n\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like \\nRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape \\nliked hardly any of the students. \\n\\n“But he seemed to really hate me.” \\n\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t \\nquite meet his eyes when he said that. \\n\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I \\nliked him a lot — great with animals.” \\n\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on \\npurpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s \\nwork with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper \\nthat was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was \\na cutting from the Daily Prophet : \\n\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST \\n\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts \\non 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark \\nwizards or witches unknown. \\n\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had \\nbeen taken. The vault that was searched had in fact \\nbeen emptied the same day. \\n\\n“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep \\nyour noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said \\na Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. \\n\\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that \\nsomeone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t \\nmentioned the date. \\n\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in \\nhappened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening \\nwhile we were there!” \\n\\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t \\nmeet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered \\nhim another rock cake. Harry read the story again. \\n\\nThe vault that was searched had in fact been emptied \\nearlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, \\ntaking out that grubby little package. Had that been \\nwhat the thieves were looking for? \\n\\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for \\ndinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes \\nthey’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that \\nnone of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as \\nmuch to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid \\ncollected that package just in time? Where was it \\nnow? And did Hagrid know something about Snape \\nthat he didn’t want to tell Harry? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL \\n\\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he \\nhated more than Dudley, but that was before he met \\nDraco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had \\nPotions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put \\nup with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until \\nthey spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor \\ncommon room that made them all groan. Flying \\nlessons would be starting on Thursday — and \\nGryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \\n\\n“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always \\nwanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in \\nfront of Malfoy.” \\n\\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more \\nthan anything else. \\n\\n“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” \\nsaid Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always \\ngoing on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet \\nthat’s all talk.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He \\ncomplained loudly about first years never getting on \\nthe House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful \\nstories that always seemed to end with him narrowly \\nescaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only \\none, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d \\nspent most of his childhood zooming around the \\ncountryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell \\nanyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a \\nhang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from \\nwizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. \\nRon had already had a big argument with Dean \\nThomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. \\nRon couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with \\nonly one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry \\nhad caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham \\nsoccer team, trying to make the players move. \\n\\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, \\nbecause his grandmother had never let him near one. \\nPrivately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because \\nNeville managed to have an extraordinary number of \\naccidents even with both feet on the ground. \\n\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about \\nflying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t \\nlearn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t \\ntried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all \\nstupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library \\nbook called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was \\nhanging on to her every word, desperate for anything \\nthat might help him hang on to his broomstick later, \\nbut everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s \\nlecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. \\n\\nHarry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, \\nsomething that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of \\ncourse. Malfoy ’s eagle owl was always bringing him \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npackages of sweets from home, which he opened \\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table. \\n\\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his \\ngrandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed \\nthem a glass ball the size of a large marble, which \\nseemed to be full of white smoke. \\n\\n“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I \\nforget things — this tells you if there’s something \\nyou’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this \\nand if it turns red — oh ...” His face fell, because the \\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve \\nforgotten something ...” \\n\\nNeville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten \\nwhen Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor \\ntable, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. \\n\\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half \\nhoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor \\nMcGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any \\nteacher in the school, was there in a flash. \\n\\n“What’s going on?” \\n\\n“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” \\n\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall \\nback on the table. \\n\\n“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with \\nCrabbe and Goyle behind him. \\n\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the \\nother Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto \\nthe grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, \\nbreezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as \\nthey marched down the sloping lawns toward a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsmooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds \\nto the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying \\ndarkly in the distance. \\n\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty \\nbroomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry \\nhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about \\nthe school brooms, saying that some of them started \\nto vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly \\nto the left. \\n\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, \\ngray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \\n\\n“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. \\n“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry \\nup.” \" \\n\\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and \\nsome of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \\n\\n“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called \\nMadam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ” \\n\\n“UP!” everyone shouted. \\n\\nHarry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it \\nwas one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had \\nsimply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t \\nmoved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell \\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a \\nquaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that \\nhe wanted to keep his feet on the ground. \\n\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their \\nbrooms without sliding off the end, and walked up \\nand down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and \\nRon were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been \\ndoing it wrong for years. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the \\nground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your \\nbrooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight \\nback down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle \\n— three — two — ” \\n\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of \\nbeing left on the ground, pushed off hard before the \\nwhistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips. \\n\\n“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising \\nstraight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve \\nfeet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face \\nlook down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, \\nslip sideways off the broom and — \\n\\nWHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay \\nfacedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was \\nstill rising higher and higher, and started to drift \\nlazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. \\n\\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as \\nwhite as his. \\n\\n“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, \\nboy — it’s all right, up you get.” \\n\\nShe turned to the rest of the class. \\n\\n“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the \\nhospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are \\nor you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \\n‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” \\n\\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, \\nhobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm \\naround him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst \\ninto laughter. \\n\\n“Did you see his face, the great lump?” \\n\\nThe other Slytherins joined in. \\n\\n“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. \\n\\n“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy \\nParkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought \\nyou’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” \\n\\n“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching \\nsomething out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing \\nLongbottom’s gran sent him.” \\n\\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \\n\\n“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone \\nstopped talking to watch. \\n\\nMalfoy smiled nastily. \\n\\n“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find \\n— how about — up a tree?” \\n\\n“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto \\nhis broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he \\ncould fly well. Hovering level with the topmost \\nbranches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, \\nPotter!” \\n\\nHarry grabbed his broom. \\n\\n“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told \\nus not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. \\n\\nHe mounted the broom and kicked hard against the \\nground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his \\nhair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in \\na rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something \\nhe could do without being taught — this was easy, \\nthis was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a \\nlittle to take it even higher, and heard screams and \\ngasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring \\nwhoop from Ron. \\n\\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in \\nmidair. Malfoy looked stunned. \\n\\n“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that \\nbroom!” \\n\\n“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking \\nworried. \\n\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward \\nand grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it \\nshot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got \\nout of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- \\nface and held the broom steady. A few people below \\nwere clapping. \\n\\n“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, \\nMalfoy,” Harry called. \\n\\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \\n\\n“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw \\nthe glass ball high into the air and streaked back \\ntoward the ground. \\n\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up \\nin the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward \\nand pointed his broom handle down — next second \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball \\n— wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the \\nscreams of people watching — he stretched out his \\nhand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in \\ntime to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently \\nonto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in \\nhis fist. \\n\\n“HARRY POTTER!” \\n\\nHis heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor \\nMcGonagall was running toward them. He got to his \\nfeet, trembling. \\n\\n“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with \\nshock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare \\nyou — might have broken your neck — ” \\n\\n“It wasn’t his fault, Professor — ” \\n\\n“Be quiet, Miss Patil — ” \\n\\n“But Malfoy — ” \\n\\n“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.” \\n\\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s \\ntriumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in \\nProfessor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the \\ncastle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. \\n\\nHe wanted to say something to defend himself, but \\nthere seemed to be something wrong with his voice. \\nProfessor McGonagall was sweeping along without \\neven looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now \\nhe’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be \\npacking his bags in ten minutes. What would the \\nDursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, \\nand still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to \\nhim. She wrenched open doors and marched along \\ncorridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. \\nMaybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He \\nthought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as \\ngamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. \\nHis stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron \\nand the others becoming wizards while he stumped \\naround the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag. \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. \\nShe opened the door and poked her head inside. \\n\\n“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood \\nfor a moment?” \\n\\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane \\nshe was going to use on him? \\n\\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year \\nboy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking \\nconfused. \\n\\n“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and \\nthey marched on up the corridor, Wood looking \\ncuriously at Harry. \\n\\n“In here.” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom \\nthat was empty except for Peeves, who was busy \\nwriting rude words on the blackboard. \\n\\n“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk \\ninto a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out \\ncursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door \\nbehind him and turned to face the two boys. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a \\nSeeker.” \\n\\nWood’s expression changed from puzzlement to \\ndelight. \\n\\n“Are you serious, Professor?” \\n\\n“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The \\nboy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was \\nthat your first time on a broomstick, Potter?” \\n\\nHarry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was \\ngoing on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and \\nsome of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \\n\\n“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot \\ndive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even \\nscratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done \\nit.” \\n\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had \\ncome true at once. \\n\\n“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked \\nexcitedly. \\n\\n“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor \\nMcGonagall explained. \\n\\n“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now \\nwalking around Harry and staring at him. “Light — \\nspeedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, \\nProfessor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a \\nCleansweep Seven, I’d say.” \\n\\n“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we \\ncan’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need \\na better team than last year. Flattened in that last \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmatch by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in \\nthe face for weeks. ...” \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses \\nat Harry. \\n\\n“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may \\nchange my mind about punishing you.” \\n\\nThen she suddenly smiled. \\n\\n“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He \\nwas an excellent Quidditch player himself.” \\n\\n“You’re joking.” \\n\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron \\nwhat had happened when he’d left the grounds with \\nProfessor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and \\nkidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all \\nabout it. \\n\\n“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must \\nbe the youngest House player in about — ” \\n\\n“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his \\nmouth. He felt particularly hungry after the \\nexcitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” \\n\\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and \\ngaped at Harry. \\n\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t \\ntell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.” \\n\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, \\nspotted Harry, and hurried over. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. \\nWe’re on the team too — Beaters.” \\n\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for \\nsure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since \\nCharlie left, but this year’s team is going to be \\nbrilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost \\nskipping when he told us.” \\n\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s \\nfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” \\n\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the \\nSmarmy that we found in our first week. See you.” \\n\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when \\nsomeone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked \\nby Crabbe and Goyle. \\n\\n“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the \\ntrain back to the Muggles?” \\n\\n“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the \\nground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” \\nsaid Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all \\nlittle about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table \\nwas full of teachers, neither of them could do more \\nthan crack their knuckles and scowl. \\n\\n“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. \\n“Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — \\nno contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a \\nwizard’s duel before, I suppose?” \\n\\n“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m \\nhis second, who’s yours?” \\n\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? Well meet you \\nin the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” \\n\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each \\nother. \\n\\n“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do \\nyou mean, you’re my second?” \\n\\n“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said \\nRon casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. \\nCatching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, \\n“But people only die in proper duels, you know, with \\nreal wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do \\nis send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows \\nenough magic to do any real damage. I bet he \\nexpected you to refuse, anyway.” \\n\\n“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” \\n\\n“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron \\nsuggested. \\n\\n“Excuse me.” \\n\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \\n\\n“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. \\n\\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \\n\\n“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy \\nwere saying — ” \\n\\n“Bet you could,” Ron muttered. \\n\\n“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school \\nat night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very \\nselfish of you.” \\n\\n“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry. \\n“Good-bye,” said Ron. \\n\\nAll the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end \\nto the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later \\nlistening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville \\nwasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent \\nall evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to \\ncurse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t \\nremember how to block them.” There was a very good \\nchance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. \\nNorris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, \\nbreaking another school rule today. On the other \\nhand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of \\nthe darkness — this was his big chance to beat \\nMalfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it. \\n\\n“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better \\ngo.” \\n\\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their \\nwands, and crept across the tower room, down the \\nspiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common \\nroom. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, \\nturning all the armchairs into hunched black \\nshadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole \\nwhen a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I \\ncan’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” \\n\\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, \\nwearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \\n\\n“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, \\n\\n“Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. \\n\\n“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the \\nportrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. \\n\\nHermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She \\nfollowed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at \\nthem like an angry goose. \\n\\n“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care \\nabout yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the \\nHouse Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from \\nProfessor McGonagall for knowing about Switching \\nSpells.” \\n\\n“Go away.” \\n\\n“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what \\nI said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, \\nyou’re so — ” \\n\\nBut what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione \\nhad turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back \\ninside and found herself facing an empty painting. \\n\\nThe Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and \\nHermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. \\n\\n“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly. \\n\\n“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, \\nwe’re going to be late.” \\n\\nThey hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor \\nwhen Hermione caught up with them. \\n\\n“I’m coming with you,” she said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are not.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for \\nFilch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell \\nhim the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you \\ncan back me up.” \\n\\n“You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly. \\n\\n“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard \\nsomething.” \\n\\nIt was a sort of snuffling. \\n\\n“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the \\ndark. \\n\\nIt wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up \\non the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake \\nas they crept nearer. \\n\\n“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for \\nhours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get \\nin to bed.” \\n\\n“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig \\nsnout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone \\noff somewhere.” \\n\\n“How’s your arm?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey \\nmended it in about a minute.” \\n\\n“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be \\nsomewhere, we’ll see you later — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \\n\\n“I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s \\nbeen past twice already.” \\n\\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at \\nHermione and Neville. \\n\\n“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve \\nlearned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us \\nabout, and used it on you.” \\n\\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron \\nexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry \\nhissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all \\nforward. \\n\\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of \\nmoonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry \\nexpected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they \\nwere lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor \\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room. \\n\\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal \\ntrophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught \\nthem. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver \\nand gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, \\nkeeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the \\nroom. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in \\nand started at once. The minutes crept by. \\n\\n“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. \\n\\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. \\n\\nHarry had only just raised his wand when they heard \\nsomeone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy. \\n\\n“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a \\ncorner.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, \\nHarry waved madly at the other three to follow him as \\nquickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the \\ndoor, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had \\nbarely whipped round the corner when they heard \\nFilch enter the trophy room. \\n\\n“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, \\n“probably hiding.” \\n\\n“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, \\npetrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full \\nof suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting \\nnearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak \\nand broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron \\naround the waist, and the pair of them toppled right \\ninto a suit of armor. \\n\\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the \\nwhole castle. \\n\\n“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted \\ndown the gallery, not looking back to see whether \\nFilch was following — they swung around the \\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then \\nanother, Harry in the lead, without any idea where \\nthey were or where they were going — they ripped \\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden \\npassageway, hurtled along it and came out near their \\nCharms classroom, which they knew was miles from \\nthe trophy room. \\n\\n“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against \\nthe cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was \\nbent double, wheezing and spluttering. \\n\\n“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the \\nstitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, \\n“quickly as possible.” \\n\\n“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You \\nrealize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet \\nyou — Filch knew someone was going to be in the \\ntrophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.” \\n\\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t \\ngoing to tell her that. \\n\\n“Let’s go.” \\n\\nIt wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone \\nmore than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled \\nand something came shooting out of a classroom in \\nfront of them. \\n\\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a \\nsqueal of delight. \\n\\n“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown \\nout.” \\n\\nPeeves cackled. \\n\\n“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, \\ntut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” \\n\\n“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” \\n\\n“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity \\nvoice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your \\nown good, you know.” \\n\\n“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at \\nPeeves — this was a big mistake. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, \\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS \\nCORRIDOR!” \\n\\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right \\nto the end of the corridor where they slammed into a \\ndoor — and it was locked. \\n\\n“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at \\nthe door, “We’re done for! This is the end!” \\n\\nThey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he \\ncould toward Peeves ’s shouts. \\n\\n“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed \\nHarry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \\n“Alohomora\\\\” \\n\\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open — they \\npiled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their \\nears against it, listening. \\n\\n“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. \\n“Quick, tell me.” \\n\\n“Say ‘please.’ ” \\n\\n“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” \\n\\n“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said \\nPeeves in his annoying singsong voice. \\n\\n“All right — please.” \\n\\n“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing \\nif you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they \\nheard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch \\ncursing in rage. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I \\nthink well be okay — get off Neville!” For Neville had \\nbeen tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the \\nlast minute. “What?” \\n\\nHarry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. \\nFor a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a \\nnightmare — this was too much, on top of everything \\nthat had happened so far. \\n\\nThey weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They \\nwere in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third \\nfloor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. \\n\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a \\nmonstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space \\nbetween ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three \\npairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and \\nquivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, \\nsaliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. \\n\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, \\nand Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t \\nalready dead was that their sudden appearance had \\ntaken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over \\nthat, there was no mistaking what those thunderous \\ngrowls meant. \\n\\nHarry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and \\ndeath, he’d take Filch. \\n\\nThey fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, \\nand they ran, they almost flew, back down the \\ncorridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them \\nsomewhere else, because they didn’t see him \\nanywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to \\ndo was put as much space as possible between them \\nand that monster. They didn’t stop running until they \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh \\nfloor. \\n\\n“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, \\nlooking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders \\nand their flushed, sweaty faces. \\n\\n“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted \\nHarry, and the portrait swung forward. They \\nscrambled into the common room and collapsed, \\ntrembling, into armchairs. \\n\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. \\nNeville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again. \\n\\n“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing \\nlike that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If \\nany dog needs exercise, that one does.” \\n\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad \\ntemper back again. \\n\\n“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she \\nsnapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” \\n\\n“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its \\nfeet, I was too busy with its heads.” \\n\\n“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s \\nobviously guarding something.” \\n\\nShe stood up, glaring at them. \\n\\n“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all \\nhave been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you \\ndon’t mind, I’m going to bed.” \\n\\nRon stared after her, his mouth open. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged \\nher along, wouldn’t you?” \\n\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to \\nthink about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was \\nguarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? \\nGringotts was the safest place in the world for \\nsomething you wanted to hide — except perhaps \\nHogwarts. \\n\\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the \\ngrubby little package from vault seven hundred and \\nthirteen was. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHALLOWEEN \\n\\nMalfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that \\nHarry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, \\nlooking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the \\nnext morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting \\nthe three-headed dog had been an excellent \\nadventure, and they were quite keen to have another \\none. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the \\npackage that seemed to have been moved from \\nGringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time \\nwondering what could possibly need such heavy \\nprotection. \\n\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said \\nRon. \\n\\n“Or both,” said Harry. \\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious \\nobject was that it was about two inches long, they \\ndidn’t have much chance of guessing what it was \\nwithout further clues. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest \\ninterest in what lay underneath the dog and the \\ntrapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near \\nthe dog again. \\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and \\nRon, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they \\nsaw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted \\nnow was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their \\ngreat delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail \\nabout a week later. \\n\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, \\neveryone’s attention was caught at once by a long, \\nthin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry \\nwas just as interested as everyone else to see what \\nwas in this large parcel, and was amazed when the \\nowls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, \\nknocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly \\nfluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a \\nletter on top of the parcel. \\n\\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, \\nbecause it said: \\n\\n\\n\\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. \\n\\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I \\ndon’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a \\nbroomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will \\nmeet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven \\no’clock for your first training session. \\n\\nProfessor M. McGonagall \\n\\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the \\nnote to Ron to read. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. \\n“I’ve never even touched one.” \\n\\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the \\nbroomstick in private before their first class, but \\nhalfway across the entrance hall they found the way \\nupstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized \\nthe package from Harry and felt it. \\n\\n“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to \\nHarry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \\n“You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t \\nallowed them.” \\n\\nRon couldn’t resist it. \\n\\n“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus \\nTwo Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, \\nMalfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. \\n“Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same \\nleague as the Nimbus.” \\n\\n“What would you know about it, Weasley, you \\ncouldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. \\n“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up \\ntwig by twig.” \\n\\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared \\nat Malfoy’s elbow. \\n\\n“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked. \\n\\n“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said \\nMalfoy quickly. \\n\\n“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, \\nbeaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all \\nabout the special circumstances, Potter. And what \\nmodel is it?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting \\nnot to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. \\n“And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” \\nhe added. \\n\\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their \\nlaughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion. \\n\\n“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the \\ntop of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen \\nNeville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. ...” \\n\\n“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking \\nrules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. \\nHermione was stomping up the stairs, looking \\ndisapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand. \\n\\n“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so \\nmuch good.” \\n\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air. \\n\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his \\nlessons that day. It kept wandering up to the \\ndormitory where his new broomstick was lying under \\nhis bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where \\nhe’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his \\ndinner that evening without noticing what he was \\neating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap \\nthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last. \\n\\n“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto \\nHarry’s bedspread. \\n\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different \\nbrooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and \\nshiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nneat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand \\nwritten in gold near the top. \\n\\nAs seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and \\nset off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d \\nnever been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of \\nseats were raised in stands around the field so that \\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was \\ngoing on. At either end of the field were three golden \\npoles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of \\nthe little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles \\nthrough, except that they were fifty feet high. \\n\\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry \\nmounted his broomstick and kicked off from the \\nground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of \\nthe goal posts and then sped up and down the field. \\nThe Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he \\nwanted at his lightest touch. \\n\\n“Hey, Potter, come down!” \\n\\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large \\nwooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to \\nhim. \\n\\n“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what \\nMcGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I’m \\njust going to teach you the rules this evening, then \\nyou’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” \\n\\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized \\nballs. \\n\\n“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to \\nunderstand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are \\nseven players on each side. Three of them are called \\nChasers.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a \\nbright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \\n\\n“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The \\nChasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and \\nget it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten \\npoints every time the Quaffle goes through one of the \\nhoops. Follow me?” \\n\\n“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through \\nthe hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of \\nlike basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t \\nit?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously. \\n\\n“Never mind,” said Harry quickly. \\n\\n“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called \\nthe Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly \\naround our hoops and stop the other team from \\nscoring.” \\n\\n“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was \\ndetermined to remember it all. “And they play with \\nthe Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He \\npointed at the three balls left inside the box. \\n\\n“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.” \\n\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short \\nbaseball bat. \\n\\n“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood \\nsaid. “These two are the Bludgers.” \\n\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and \\nslightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat they seemed to be straining to escape the straps \\nholding them inside the box. \\n\\n“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and \\nfreed one of the Bludgers. \\n\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then \\npelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with \\nthe bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it \\nzigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their \\nheads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it \\nand managed to pin it to the ground. \\n\\n“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger \\nback into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The \\nBludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off \\ntheir brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on \\neach team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their \\njob to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and \\nknock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve \\ngot all that?” \\n\\n“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the \\nKeeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the \\nBludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off. \\n\\n“Very good,” said Wood. \\n\\n“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry \\nasked, hoping he sounded offhand. \\n\\n“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken \\njaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last \\nmember of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And \\nyou don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the \\nBludgers — ” \\n\\n“ — unless they crack my head open.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for \\nthe Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human \\nBludgers themselves.” \\n\\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth \\nand last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the \\nBludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. \\nIt was bright gold and had little fluttering silver \\nwings. \\n\\n“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the \\nmost important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch \\nbecause it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the \\nSeeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out \\nof the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get \\nit before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever \\nSeeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra \\nhundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. \\nThat’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of \\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it \\ncan go on for ages — I think the record is three \\nmonths, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so \\nthe players could get some sleep. \\n\\n“Well, that’s it — any questions?” \\n\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to \\ndo all right, it was doing it that was going to be the \\nproblem. \\n\\n“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, \\ncarefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too \\ndark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of \\nthese.” \\n\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket \\nand a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the \\nair, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could \\nin every direction for Harry to catch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was \\ndelighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen \\nand they couldn’t carry on. \\n\\n“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” \\nsaid Wood happily as they trudged back up to the \\ncastle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better \\nthan Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for \\nEngland if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” \\n\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what \\nwith Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top \\nof all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it \\nwhen he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts \\ntwo months. The castle felt more like home than \\nPrivet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming \\nmore and more interesting now that they had \\nmastered the basics. \\n\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious \\nsmell of baking pumpkin wafting through the \\ncorridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced \\nin Charms that he thought they were ready to start \\nmaking objects fly, something they had all been dying \\nto try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom \\naround the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the \\nclass into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was \\nSeamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville \\nhad been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was \\nto be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to \\ntell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. \\nShe hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day \\nHarry’s broomstick had arrived. \\n\\n“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve \\nbeen practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, \\nperched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish \\nand flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the \\nmagic words properly is very important, too — never \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nforget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and \\nfound himself on the floor with a buffalo on his \\nchest.” \\n\\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and \\nflicked, but the feather they were supposed to be \\nsending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got \\nso impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set \\nfire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat. \\n\\nRon, at the next table, wasn’t having much more \\nluck. \\n\\n“Wingardium Leviosal” he shouted, waving his long \\narms like a windmill. \\n\\n“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. \\n“It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and \\nlong.” \\n\\n“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled. \\n\\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked \\nher wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ \\n\\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four \\nfeet above their heads. \\n\\n“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \\n“Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!” \\n\\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \\n\\n“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to \\nHarry as they pushed their way into the crowded \\ncorridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past \\nhim. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her \\nface — and was startled to see that she was in tears. \\n\\n“I think she heard you.” \\n\\n“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \\n“She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” \\n\\nHermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t \\nseen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great \\nHall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard \\nParvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione \\nwas crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be \\nleft alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but \\na moment later they had entered the Great Hall, \\nwhere the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of \\ntheir minds. \\n\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and \\nceiling while a thousand more swooped over the \\ntables in low black clouds, making the candles in the \\npumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on \\nthe golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term \\nbanquet. \\n\\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato \\nwhen Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, \\nhis turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone \\nstared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, \\nslumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in \\nthe dungeons — thought you ought to know.” \\n\\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint. \\n\\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple \\nfirecrackers exploding from the end of Professor \\nDumbledore’s wand to bring silence. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the \\ndormitories immediately!” \\n\\nPercy was in his element. \\n\\n“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear \\nthe troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind \\nme, now. Make way, first years coming through! \\nExcuse me, I’m a prefect!” \\n\\n“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they \\nclimbed the stairs. \\n\\n“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” \\nsaid Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween \\njoke.” \\n\\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in \\ndifferent directions. As they jostled their way through \\na crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly \\ngrabbed Ron’s arm. \\n\\n“I’ve just thought — Hermione.” \\n\\n“What about her?” \\n\\n“She doesn’t know about the troll.” \\n\\nRon bit his lip. \\n\\n“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not \\nsee us.” \\n\\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the \\nother way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and \\nhurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just \\nturned the corner when they heard quick footsteps \\nbehind them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large \\nstone griffin. \\n\\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but \\nSnape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from \\nview. \\n\\n“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he \\ndown in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” \\n\\n“Search me.” \\n\\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor \\nafter Snape ’s fading footsteps. \\n\\n“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron \\nheld up his hand. \\n\\n“Can you smell something?” \\n\\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a \\nmixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no \\none seems to clean. \\n\\nAnd then they heard it — a low grunting, and the \\nshuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at \\nthe end of a passage to the left, something huge was \\nmoving toward them. They shrank into the shadows \\nand watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. \\n\\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a \\ndull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder \\nwith its small bald head perched on top like a \\ncoconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with \\nflat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was \\nincredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which \\ndragged along the floor because its arms were so long. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. \\nIt waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then \\nslouched slowly into the room. \\n\\n“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could \\nlock it in.” \\n\\n“Good idea,” said Ron nervously. \\n\\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, \\npraying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With \\none great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam \\nthe door, and lock it. \\n\\n“Yes!” \\n\\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back \\nup the passage, but as they reached the corner they \\nheard something that made their hearts stop — a \\nhigh, petrified scream — and it was coming from the \\nchamber they’d just chained up. \\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \\n\\n“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped. \\n\\n“ Hermionel” they said together. \\n\\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what \\nchoice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted \\nback to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their \\npanic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran \\ninside. \\n\\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall \\nopposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll \\nwas advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the \\nwalls as it went. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, \\nseizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against \\nthe wall. \\n\\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It \\nlumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had \\nmade the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It \\nhesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club \\nas it went. \\n\\n“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the \\nchamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll \\ndidn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its \\nshoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, \\nturning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving \\nHarry time to run around it. \\n\\n“Come on, run, run\\\\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying \\nto pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, \\nshe was still flat against the wall, her mouth open \\nwith terror. \\n\\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the \\ntroll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, \\nwho was nearest and had no way to escape. \\n\\nHarry then did something that was both very brave \\nand very stupid: He took a great running jump and \\nmanaged to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck \\nfrom behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging \\nthere, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit \\nof wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been \\nin his hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight \\nup one of the troll’s nostrils. \\n\\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its \\nclub, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, \\nthe troll was going to rip him off or catch him a \\nterrible blow with the club. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled \\nout his own wand — not knowing what he was going \\nto do he heard himself cry the first spell that came \\ninto his head: “Wingardium Leviosal” \\n\\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose \\nhigh, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and \\ndropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s \\nhead. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat \\non its face, with a thud that made the whole room \\ntremble. \\n\\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of \\nbreath. Ron was standing there with his wand still \\nraised, staring at what he had done. \\n\\nIt was Hermione who spoke first. \\n\\n“Is it — dead?” \\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been \\nknocked out.” \\n\\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s \\nnose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray \\nglue. \\n\\n“Urgh — troll boogers.” \\n\\nHe wiped it on the troll’s trousers. \\n\\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the \\nthree of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a \\nracket they had been making, but of course, someone \\ndownstairs must have heard the crashes and the \\ntroll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall \\nhad come bursting into the room, closely followed by \\nSnape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntook one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and \\nsat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. \\n\\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was \\nlooking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her \\nlook so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning \\nfifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s \\nmind. \\n\\n“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor \\nMcGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked \\nat Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the \\nair. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you \\nin your dormitory?” \\n\\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked \\nat the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. \\n\\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows. \\n\\n“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for \\nme.” \\n\\n“Miss Granger!” \\n\\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \\n\\n“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I \\ncould deal with it on my own — you know, because \\nI’ve read all about them.” \\n\\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a \\ndownright lie to a teacher? \\n\\n“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry \\nstuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out \\nwith its own club. They didn’t have time to come and \\nfetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they \\narrived.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story \\nwasn’t new to them. \\n\\n“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, \\nstaring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you \\nfoolish girl, how could you think of tackling a \\nmountain troll on your own?” \\n\\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. \\nHermione was the last person to do anything against \\nthe rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to \\nget them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started \\nhanding out sweets. \\n\\n“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from \\nGryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m \\nvery disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, \\nyou’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are \\nfinishing the feast in their Houses.” \\n\\nHermione left. \\n\\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \\n\\n“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first \\nyears could have taken on a full-grown mountain \\ntroll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor \\nDumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.” \\n\\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at \\nall until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief \\nto be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from \\nanything else. \\n\\n“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron \\ngrumbled. \\n\\n“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione ’s.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron \\nadmitted. “Mind you, we did save her.” \\n\\n“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t \\nlocked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him. \\n\\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \\n\\n“Pig snout,” they said and entered. \\n\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone \\nwas eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, \\nhowever, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. \\nThere was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of \\nthem looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” \\nand hurried off to get plates. \\n\\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became \\ntheir friend. There are some things you can’t share \\nwithout ending up liking each other, and knocking \\nout a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQUIDDITCH \\n\\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very \\ncold. The mountains around the school became icy \\ngray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the \\nground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen \\nfrom the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on \\nthe Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin \\novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin \\nboots. \\n\\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry \\nwould be playing in his first match after weeks of \\ntraining: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor \\nwon, they would move up into second place in the \\nHouse Championship. \\n\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood \\nhad decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry \\nshould be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was \\nplaying Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry \\ndidn’t know which was worse — people telling him \\nhe’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be \\nrunning around underneath him holding a mattress. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a \\nfriend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through \\nall his homework without her, what with all the last- \\nminute Quidditch practice Wood was making them \\ndo. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, \\nwhich turned out to be a very interesting read. \\n\\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of \\ncommitting a Quidditch foul and that all of them had \\nhappened during a World Cup match in 1473; that \\nSeekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, \\nand that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to \\nhappen to them; that although people rarely died \\nplaying Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish \\nand turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. \\n\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about \\nbreaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her \\nfrom the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for \\nit. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the \\nthree of them were out in the freezing courtyard \\nduring break, and she had conjured them up a bright \\nblue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. \\nThey were standing with their backs to it, getting \\nwarm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at \\nonce that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione moved closer together to block the fire from \\nview; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. \\nUnfortunately, something about their guilty faces \\ncaught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen \\nthe fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to \\ntell them off anyway. \\n\\n“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” \\n\\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Library books are not to be taken outside the \\nschool,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from \\nGryffindor.” \\n\\n“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily \\nas Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with \\nhis leg?” \\n\\n“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron \\nbitterly. \\n\\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that \\nevening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next \\nto a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s \\nCharms homework for them. She would never let \\nthem copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her \\nto read it through, they got the right answers anyway. \\n\\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the \\nAges back, to take his mind off his nerves about \\ntomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting \\nup, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask \\nSnape if he could have it. \\n\\n“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry \\nhad an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were \\nother teachers listening. \\n\\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. \\nThere was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. \\n\\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was \\nworth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered \\ninside — and a horrible scene met his eyes. \\n\\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was \\nholding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was \\nbloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape \\nbandages. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you \\nsupposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at \\nonce?” \\n\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but — \\n\\n“POTTER!” \\n\\nSnape ’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his \\nrobes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. \\n\\n“I just wondered if I could have my book back.” \\n\\n“GET OUT! OUT!” \\n\\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points \\nfrom Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. \\n\\n“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. \\n“What’s the matter?” \\n\\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen. \\n\\n“You know what this means?” he finished \\nbreathlessly. “He tried to get past that three-headed \\ndog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we \\nsaw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d \\nbet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a \\ndiversion!” \\n\\nHermione’s eyes were wide. \\n\\n“No — he wouldn’t,” she said. “I know he’s not very \\nnice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something \\nDumbledore was keeping safe.” \\n\\n“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints \\nor something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he \\nafter? What’s that dog guarding?” \\n\\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the \\nsame question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry \\ncouldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he \\nneeded to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch \\nmatch in a few hours — but the expression on \\nSnape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy \\nto forget. \\n\\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The \\nGreat Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried \\nsausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking \\nforward to a good Quidditch match. \\n\\n“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” \\n\\n“I don’t want anything.” \\n\\n“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione. \\n\\n“I’m not hungry.” \\n\\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking \\nonto the field. \\n\\n“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus \\nFinnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get \\nclobbered by the other team.” \\n\\n“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile \\nketchup on his sausages. \\n\\nBy eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out \\nin the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many \\nstudents had binoculars. The seats might be raised \\nhigh in the air, but it was still difficult to see what \\nwas going on sometimes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean \\nthe West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for \\nHarry, they had painted a large banner on one of the \\nsheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for \\nPresident, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had \\ndone a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then \\nHermione had performed a tricky little charm so that \\nthe paint flashed different colors. \\n\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of \\nthe team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch \\nrobes (Slytherin would be playing in green) . \\n\\nWood cleared his throat for silence. \\n\\n“Okay, men,” he said. \\n\\n“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \\n\\n“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.” \\n\\n“The big one,” said Fred Weasley. \\n\\n“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George. \\n\\n“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, \\n“we were on the team last year.” \\n\\n“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team \\nGryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know \\nit.” \\n\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.” \\n\\n“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.” \\n\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker \\nroom and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, \\nwalked onto the field to loud cheers. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the \\nmiddle of the field waiting for the two teams, her \\nbroom in her hand. \\n\\n“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, \\nonce they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed \\nthat she seemed to be speaking particularly to the \\nSlytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry \\nthought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in \\nhim. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering \\nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over \\nthe crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. \\n\\n“Mount your brooms, please.” \\n\\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. \\n\\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. \\n\\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They \\nwere off. \\n\\n“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina \\nJohnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser \\nthat girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” \\n\\n“JORDAN!” \\n\\n“Sorry, Professor.” \\n\\nThe Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the \\ncommentary for the match, closely watched by \\nProfessor McGonagall. \\n\\n“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass \\nto Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last \\nyear only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the \\nSlytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain \\nMarcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nflying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no, \\nstopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper \\nWood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s \\nChaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive \\naround Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that \\nmust have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a \\nBludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s \\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but \\nhe’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by \\nFred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play \\nby the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back \\nin possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and \\noff she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding \\nBludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, \\nAngelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — \\nGRYFFINDORS SCORE!” \\n\\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and \\nmoans from the Slytherins. \\n\\n“Budge up there, move along.” \\n\\n“Hagrid!” \\n\\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid \\nenough space to join them. \\n\\n“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a \\nlarge pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t \\nthe same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch \\nyet, eh?” \\n\\n“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” \\n\\n“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said \\nHagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at \\nthe speck that was Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, \\nsquinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was \\npart of his and Wood’s game plan. \\n\\n“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the \\nSnitch,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked \\nbefore you have to be.” \\n\\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple \\nof loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was \\nback to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught \\nsight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection \\nfrom one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a \\nBludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a \\ncannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and \\nFred Weasley came chasing after it. \\n\\n“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he \\nbeat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. \\n\\n“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, \\n“Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, \\nand Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a \\nmoment — was that the Snitch?” \\n\\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey \\ndropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his \\nshoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left \\near. \\n\\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived \\ndownward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker \\nTerence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they \\nhurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed \\nto have forgotten what they were supposed to be \\ndoing as they hung in midair to watch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little \\nround ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he \\nput on an extra spurt of speed — \\n\\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors \\nbelow — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, \\nand Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on \\nfor dear life. \\n\\n“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors. \\n\\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered \\na free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all \\nthe confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had \\ndisappeared from sight again. \\n\\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send \\nhim off, ref! Red card!” \\n\\n“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron. \\n\\n“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get \\nshown the red card and you’re out of the game!” \\n\\n“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him. \\n\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean’s side. \\n\\n“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked \\nHarry outta the air.” \\n\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \\n\\n“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of \\ncheating — ” \\n\\n“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall. \\n\\n“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Jordan, I’m warning you — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor \\nSeeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a \\npenalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it \\naway, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor \\nstill in possession.” \\n\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went \\nspinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. \\nHis broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a \\nsplit second, he thought he was going to fall. He \\ngripped the broom tightly with both his hands and \\nknees. He’d never felt anything like that. \\n\\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was \\ntrying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands \\ndid not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry \\ntried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — \\nhe had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — \\nand then he realized that his broom was completely \\nout of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t \\ndirect it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and \\nevery now and then making violent swishing \\nmovements that almost unseated him. \\n\\nLee was still commentating. \\n\\n“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — \\npasses Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face \\nby a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, \\nProfessor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” \\n\\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have \\nnoticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It \\nwas carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, \\njerking and twitching as it went. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid \\nmumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I \\ndidn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his \\nbroom ... but he can’t have. ...” \\n\\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over \\nthe stands. His broom had started to roll over and \\nover, with him only just managing to hold on. Then \\nthe whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a \\nwild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling \\nfrom it, holding on with only one hand. \\n\\n“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” \\nSeamus whispered. \\n\\n“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t \\nnothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful \\nDark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two \\nThousand.” \\n\\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, \\nbut instead of looking up at Harry, she started \\nlooking frantically at the crowd. \\n\\n“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced. \\n\\n“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” \\n\\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle \\nof the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on \\nHarry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \\n\\n“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said \\nHermione. \\n\\n“What should we do?” \\n\\n“Leave it to me.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had \\ndisappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on \\nHarry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost \\nimpossible for him to hang on much longer. The \\nwhole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the \\nWeasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one \\nof their brooms, but it was no good — every time they \\ngot near him, the broom would jump higher still. They \\ndropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously \\nhoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the \\nQuaffle and scored five times without anyone \\nnoticing. \\n\\n“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately. \\n\\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand \\nwhere Snape stood, and was now racing along the row \\nbehind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she \\nknocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in \\nfront. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled \\nout her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen \\nwords. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto \\nthe hem of Snape ’s robes. \\n\\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize \\nthat he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had \\ndone her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar \\nin her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — \\nSnape would never know what had happened. \\n\\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able \\nto clamber back on to his broom. \\n\\n“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been \\nsobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes. \\n\\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the \\ncrowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours \\n— coughed — and something gold fell into his hand. \\n\\n“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his \\nhead, and the game ended in complete confusion. \\n\\n“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was \\nstill howling twenty minutes later, but it made no \\ndifference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee \\nJordan was still happily shouting the results — \\nGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy \\npoints to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He \\nwas being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s \\nhut, with Ron and Hermione. \\n\\n“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I \\nsaw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, \\nhe wouldn’t take his eyes off you.” \\n\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of \\nwhat had gone on next to him in the stands. “Why \\nwould Snape do somethin’ like that?” \\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, \\nwondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the \\ntruth. \\n\\n“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. \\n“He tried to get past that three-headed dog on \\nHalloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal \\nwhatever it’s guarding.” \\n\\nHagrid dropped the teapot. \\n\\n“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said. \\n\\n“ Fluffy ?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie \\nI met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore \\nto guard the — ” \\n\\n“Yes?” said Harry eagerly. \\n\\n“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. \\n“That’s top secret, that is.” \\n\\n“But Snape’s trying to steal it.” \\n\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts \\nteacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.” \\n\\n“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried \\nHermione. \\n\\nThe afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have \\nchanged her mind about Snape. \\n\\n“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all \\nabout them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and \\nSnape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!” \\n\\n“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ \\nknow why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape \\nwouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all \\nthree of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ \\nconcern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ \\nyou forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor \\nDumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” \\n\\n“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas \\nFlamel involved, is there?” \\n\\nHagrid looked furious with himself. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED \\n\\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid- \\nDecember, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in \\nseveral feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the \\nWeasley twins were punished for bewitching several \\nsnowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, \\nbouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that \\nmanaged to battle their way through the stormy sky \\nto deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by \\nHagrid before they could fly off again. \\n\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the \\nGryffindor common room and the Great Hall had \\nroaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and \\na bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. \\nWorst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in \\nthe dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist \\nbefore them and they kept as close as possible to \\ntheir hot cauldrons. \\n\\n“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions \\nclass, “for all those people who have to stay at \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted \\nat home.” \\n\\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and \\nGoyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out \\npowdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had \\nbeen even more unpleasant than usual since the \\nQuidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had \\nlost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a \\nwide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as \\nSeeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found \\nthis funny, because they were all so impressed at the \\nway Harry had managed to stay on his bucking \\nbroomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone \\nback to taunting Harry about having no proper \\nfamily. \\n\\nIt was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet \\nDrive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come \\naround the week before, making a list of students \\nwho would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had \\nsigned up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at \\nall; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d \\never had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, \\nbecause Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania \\nto visit Charlie. \\n\\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, \\nthey found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. \\nTwo enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a \\nloud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind \\nit. \\n\\n“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his \\nhead through the branches. \\n\\n“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came \\nMalfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying \\nto earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be \\ngamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I \\nsuppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a \\npalace compared to what your family’s used to.” \\n\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \\n\\n“WEASLEY!” \\n\\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes. \\n\\n“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, \\nsticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \\n“Malfoy was insultin’ his family.” \\n\\n“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, \\nHagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from \\nGryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. \\nMove along, all of you.” \\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the \\ntree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \\n\\n“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s \\nback, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ” \\n\\n“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” \\n\\n“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said \\nHagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the \\nGreat Hall, looks a treat.” \\n\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off \\nto the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and \\nProfessor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas \\ndecorations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, \\nwould you?” \\n\\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and \\nmistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than \\ntwelve towering Christmas trees stood around the \\nroom, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering \\nwith hundreds of candles. \\n\\n“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” \\nHagrid asked. \\n\\n“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — \\nHarry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we \\nshould be in the library.” \\n\\n“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes \\naway from Professor Flitwick, who had golden \\nbubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing \\nthem over the branches of the new tree. \\n\\n“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the \\nhall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” \\n\\n“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. \\n\\n“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been \\ntrying to find out who he is.” \\n\\n“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — \\nI’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that \\ndog’s guardin’.” \\n\\n“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s \\nall,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” \\nHarry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of \\nbooks already and we can’t find him anywhere — just \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngive us a hint — I know I’ve read his name \\nsomewhere.” \\n\\n“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly. \\n\\n“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, \\nand they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried \\noff to the library. \\n\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s \\nname ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how \\nelse were they going to find out what Snape was \\ntrying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to \\nknow where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might \\nhave done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in \\nGreat Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable \\nMagical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from \\nImportant Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of \\nRecent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of \\ncourse, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of \\nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds \\nof narrow rows. \\n\\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had \\ndecided to search while Ron strode off down a row of \\nbooks and started pulling them off the shelves at \\nrandom. Harry wandered over to the Restricted \\nSection. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel \\nwasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you \\nneeded a specially signed note from one of the \\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he \\nknew he’d never get one. These were the books \\ncontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at \\nHogwarts, and only read by older students studying \\nadvanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \\n\\n“What are you looking for, boy?” \\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather \\nduster at him. \\n\\n“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!” \\n\\nWishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some \\nstory, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione \\nhad already agreed they’d better not ask Madam \\nPince where they could find Flamel. They were sure \\nshe’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk \\nSnape hearing what they were up to. \\n\\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other \\ntwo had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. \\nThey had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as \\nthey only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t \\nsurprising they’d found nothing. What they really \\nneeded was a nice long search without Madam Pince \\nbreathing down their necks. \\n\\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, \\nshaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \\n\\n“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” \\nsaid Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find \\nanything.” \\n\\n“And you could ask your parents if they know who \\nFlamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.” \\n\\n“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione. \\n\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were \\nhaving too good a time to think much about Flamel. \\nThey had the dormitory to themselves and the \\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they \\nwere able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They \\nsat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a \\ntoasting fork — bread, English muffins, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmarshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy \\nexpelled, which were fun to talk about even if they \\nwouldn’t work. \\n\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This \\nwas exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures \\nwere alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in \\nbattle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like \\neverything else he owned, it had once belonged to \\nsomeone else in his family — in this case, his \\ngrandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a \\ndrawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had \\ntrouble getting them to do what he wanted. \\n\\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had \\nlent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a \\nvery good player yet and they kept shouting different \\nbits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t \\nsend me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we \\ncan afford to lose him.” \\n\\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward \\nto the next day for the food and the fun, but not \\nexpecting any presents at all. When he woke early in \\nthe morning, however, the first thing he saw was a \\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \\n\\n“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry \\nscrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \\n\\n“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got \\nsome presents!” \\n\\n“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to \\nhis own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s. \\n\\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in \\nthick brown paper and scrawled across it was To \\nHarry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nflute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry \\nblew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. \\n\\nA second, very small parcel contained a note. \\n\\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas \\npresent. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped \\nto the note was a fifty-pence piece. \\n\\n“That’s friendly,” said Harry. \\n\\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence. \\n\\n“ Weird\\\\ ” he said, “What a shape! This is money?” \\n\\n“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how \\npleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — \\nso who sent these?” \\n\\n“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, \\nturning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy \\nparcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any \\npresents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you \\na Weasley sweater.” \\n\\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- \\nknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of \\nhomemade fudge. \\n\\n“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, \\nunwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.” \\n\\n“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the \\nfudge, which was very tasty. \\n\\nHis next present also contained candy — a large box \\nof Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt \\nit. It was very light. He unwrapped it. \\n\\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the \\nfloor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \\n\\n“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, \\ndropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten \\nfrom Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re \\nreally rare, and really valuable.” \\n\\n“What is it?” \\n\\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It \\nwas strange to the touch, like water woven into \\nmaterial. \\n\\n“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on \\nhis face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.” \\n\\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron \\ngave a yell. \\n\\n“It is! Look down!” \\n\\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He \\ndashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection \\nlooked back at him, just his head suspended in \\nmidair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the \\ncloak over his head and his reflection vanished \\ncompletely. \\n\\n“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of \\nit!” \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. \\nWritten in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen \\nbefore were the following words: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour father left this in my possession before he died. It \\nis time it was returned to you. \\n\\nUse it well. \\n\\nA Very Merry Christmas to you. \\n\\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron \\nwas admiring the cloak. \\n\\n“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” he said. “Anuthinq. \\nWhat’s the matter?” \\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had \\nsent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his \\nfather? \\n\\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the \\ndormitory door was flung open and Fred and George \\nWeasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly \\nout of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone \\nelse yet. \\n\\n“Merry Christmas!” \\n\\n“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” \\n\\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one \\nwith a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \\n\\n“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, \\nholding up Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes \\nmore of an effort if you’re not family.” \\n\\n“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George \\ndemanded. “Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and \\nwarm.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he \\npulled it over his head. \\n\\n“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. \\n\\n“I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But \\nwe’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and \\nForge.” \\n\\n“What’s all this noise?” \\n\\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, \\nlooking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway \\nthrough unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a \\nlumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. \\n\\n“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all \\nwearing ours, even Harry got one.” \\n\\n“I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins \\nforced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses \\naskew. \\n\\n“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, \\neither,” said George. “Christmas is a time for family.” \\n\\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms \\npinned to his side by his sweater. \\n\\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas \\ndinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of \\nroast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; \\ntureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich \\ngravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard \\ncrackers every few feet along the table. These \\nfantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble \\nMuggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their \\nlittle plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. \\nHarry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t \\njust bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nengulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from \\nthe inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several \\nlive, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore \\nhad swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered \\nbonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor \\nFlitwick had just read him. \\n\\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. \\nPercy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle \\nembedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting \\nredder and redder in the face as he called for more \\nwine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the \\ncheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and \\nblushed, her top hat lopsided. \\n\\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down \\nwith a stack of things out of the crackers, including a \\npack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- \\nYour-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess \\nset. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a \\nnasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. \\nNorris’s Christmas dinner. \\n\\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon \\nhaving a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, \\ncold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the \\nfire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry \\nbroke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to \\nRon. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if \\nPercy hadn’t tried to help him so much. \\n\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, \\nand Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy \\nto do much before bed except sit and watch Percy \\nchase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower \\nbecause they’d stolen his prefect badge. \\n\\nIt had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet \\nsomething had been nagging at the back of his mind \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to \\nthink about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had \\nsent it. \\n\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing \\nmysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon \\nas he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry \\nleaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the \\ncloak out from under it. \\n\\nHis father’s ... this had been his father’s. He let the \\nmaterial flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light \\nas air. Use it well, the note had said. \\n\\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and \\nwrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at \\nhis legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a \\nvery funny feeling. \\n\\nUse it well. \\n\\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of \\nHogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement \\nflooded through him as he stood there in the dark \\nand silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, \\nand Filch would never know. \\n\\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? \\nSomething held him back — his father’s cloak — he \\nfelt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use \\nit alone. \\n\\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across \\nthe common room, and climbed through the portrait \\nhole. \\n\\n“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said \\nnothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, \\nand thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted \\nSection in the library. He’d be able to read as long as \\nhe liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel \\nwas. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight \\naround him as he walked. \\n\\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a \\nlamp to see his way along the rows of books. The \\nlamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and \\neven though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, \\nthe sight gave him the creeps. \\n\\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the \\nlibrary. Stepping carefully over the rope that \\nseparated these books from the rest of the library, he \\nheld up his lamp to read the titles. \\n\\nThey didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold \\nletters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t \\nunderstand. Some had no title at all. One book had a \\ndark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The \\nhairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he \\nwas imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint \\nwhispering was coming from the books, as though \\nthey knew someone was there who shouldn’t be. \\n\\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down \\ncarefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom \\nshelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black \\nand silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out \\nwith difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, \\nbalancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \\n\\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — \\nthe book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but \\nthe shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, \\nearsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked \\nover his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nheard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — \\nstuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran \\nfor it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, \\nwild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry \\nslipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked \\noff up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in \\nhis ears. \\n\\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of \\narmor. He had been so busy getting away from the \\nlibrary, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was \\ngoing. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t \\nrecognize where he was at all. There was a suit of \\narmor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be \\nfive floors above there. \\n\\n“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if \\nanyone was wandering around at night, and \\nsomebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” \\n\\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he \\nwas, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, \\ngreasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it \\nwas Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, \\nthey can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” \\n\\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape \\ncame around the corner ahead. They couldn’t see \\nhim, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if \\nthey came much nearer they’d knock right into him — \\nthe cloak didn’t stop him from being solid. \\n\\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood \\najar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed \\nthrough it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, \\nand to his relief he managed to get inside the room \\nwithout their noticing anything. They walked straight \\npast, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing \\ndeeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhad been close, very close. It was a few seconds \\nbefore he noticed anything about the room he had \\nhidden in. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes \\nof desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and \\nthere was an upturned wastepaper basket — but \\npropped against the wall facing him was something \\nthat didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that \\nlooked as if someone had just put it there to keep it \\nout of the way. \\n\\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, \\nwith an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed \\nfeet. There was an inscription carved around the top: \\nErised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. \\n\\nHis panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch \\nand Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, \\nwanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. \\nHe stepped in front of it. \\n\\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself \\nfrom screaming. He whirled around. His heart was \\npounding far more furiously than when the book had \\nscreamed — for he had seen not only himself in the \\nmirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right \\nbehind him. \\n\\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he \\nturned slowly back to the mirror. \\n\\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared- \\nlooking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least \\nten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, \\nno one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was \\nhe in fact in a room full of invisible people and this \\nmirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or \\nnot? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing \\nright behind his reflection was smiling at him and \\nwaving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind \\nhim. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their \\nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air \\n— she and the others existed only in the mirror. \\n\\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair \\nand her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry \\nthought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright \\ngreen — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed \\nthat she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same \\ntime. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next \\nto her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and \\nhis hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just \\nas Harry’s did. \\n\\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose \\nwas nearly touching that of his reflection. \\n\\n“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?” \\n\\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry \\nlooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, \\nand saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses \\nlike his, even a little old man who looked as though \\nhe had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at \\nhis family, for the first time in his life. \\n\\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared \\nhungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against \\nthe glass as though he was hoping to fall right \\nthrough it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of \\nache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \\n\\nHow long he stood there, he didn’t know. The \\nreflections did not fade and he looked and looked \\nuntil a distant noise brought him back to his senses. \\nHe couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, \\nwhispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the \\nroom. \\n\\n“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly. \\n\\n“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show \\nyou the mirror.” \\n\\n“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly. \\n\\n“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, \\nyou’ll be able to show me your other brothers and \\neveryone.” \\n\\n“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just \\ncome round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe \\nit only shows dead people. Shame about not finding \\nFlamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why \\naren’t you eating anything?” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and \\nwould be seeing them again tonight. He had almost \\nforgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important \\nanymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was \\nguarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \\n\\n“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.” \\n\\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be \\nable to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered \\nin the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly \\nthe next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from \\nthe library, wandering around the dark passageways \\nfor nearly an hour. \\n\\n“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.” \\n\\n“IVo!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the \\nopposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron \\nstarted moaning that his feet were dead with cold, \\nHarry spotted the suit of armor. \\n\\n“It’s here — just here — yes!” \\n\\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak \\nfrom around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. \\n\\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the \\nsight of him. \\n\\n“See?” Harry whispered. \\n\\n“I can’t see anything.” \\n\\n“Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...” \\n“I can only see you.” \\n\\n“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” \\n\\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the \\nmirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron \\nin his paisley pajamas. \\n\\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \\n“Look at me!” he said. \\n\\n“Can you see all your family standing around you?” \\n\\n“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — \\nand I’m Head Boy!” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and \\nI’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — \\nI’m Quidditch captain, too!” \\n\\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to \\nlook excitedly at Harry. \\n\\n“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” \\n\\n“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have \\nanother look — ” \\n\\n“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit \\nmore time.” \\n\\n“You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s \\ninteresting about that? I want to see my parents.” \\n\\n“Don’t push me — ” \\n\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to \\ntheir discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they \\nhad been talking. \\n\\n“Quick!” \\n\\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous \\neyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and \\nHarry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing \\n— did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an \\nage, she turned and left. \\n\\n“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet \\nshe heard us. Come on.” \\n\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room. \\n\\nThe snow still hadn’t melted the next morning. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n“No.” \\n\\n“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?” \\n\\n“No ... you go ...” \\n\\n“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that \\nmirror. Don’t go back tonight.” \\n\\n“Why not?” \\n\\n“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and \\nanyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. \\nFilch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. \\nSo what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into \\nyou? What if you knock something over?” \\n\\n“You sound like Hermione.” \\n\\n“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” \\n\\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which \\nwas to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t \\ngoing to stop him. \\n\\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than \\nbefore. He was walking so fast he knew he was \\nmaking more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet \\nanyone. \\n\\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him \\nagain, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. \\nHarry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the \\nmirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying \\nhere all night with his family. Nothing at all. \\n\\nExcept — \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So — back again, Harry?” \\n\\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He \\nlooked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the \\nwall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry \\nmust have walked straight past him, so desperate to \\nget to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him. \\n\\n“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” \\n\\n“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make \\nyou,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see \\nthat he was smiling. \\n\\n“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on \\nthe floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, \\nhave discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” \\n\\n“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” \\n\\n“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” \\n\\n“It — well — it shows me my family — ” \\n\\n“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” \\n\\n“How did you know — ?” \\n\\n“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said \\nDumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the \\nMirror of Erised shows us all?” \\n\\nHarry shook his head. \\n\\n“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be \\nable to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, \\nthat is, he would look into it and see himself exactly \\nas he is. Does that help?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us \\nwhat we want ... whatever we want ...” \\n\\n“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us \\nnothing more or less than the deepest, most \\ndesperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never \\nknown your family, see them standing around you. \\nRonald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed \\nby his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best \\nof all of them. However, this mirror will give us \\nneither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away \\nbefore it, entranced by what they have seen, or been \\ndriven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or \\neven possible. \\n\\n“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, \\nHarry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If \\nyou ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It \\ndoes not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, \\nremember that. Now, why don’t you put that \\nadmirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” \\n\\nHarry stood up. \\n\\n“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you \\nsomething?” \\n\\n“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. \\n“You may ask me one more thing, however.” \\n\\n“What do you see when you look in the mirror?” \\n\\n“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” \\n\\nHarry stared. \\n\\n“One can never have enough socks,” said \\nDumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on \\ngiving me books.” \\n\\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck \\nHarry that Dumbledore might not have been quite \\ntruthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved \\nScabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal \\nquestion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNICHOLAS FLAMBL \\n\\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking \\nfor the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the \\nChristmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed \\nfolded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he \\ncould forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, \\nbut he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over \\nand over again he dreamed about his parents \\ndisappearing in a flash of green light, while a high \\nvoice cackled with laughter. \\n\\n“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could \\ndrive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about \\nthese dreams. \\n\\nHermione, who came back the day before term \\nstarted, took a different view of things. She was torn \\nbetween horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, \\nroaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had \\ncaught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at \\nleast found out who Nicolas Flamel was. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel \\nin a library book, even though Harry was still sure \\nhe’d read the name somewhere. Once term had \\nstarted, they were back to skimming through books \\nfor ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even \\nless time than the other two, because Quidditch \\npractice had started again. \\n\\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even \\nthe endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t \\ndampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that \\nWood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on \\nWood’s side. If they won their next match, against \\nHufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the \\nHouse Championship for the first time in seven years. \\nQuite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he \\nhad fewer nightmares when he was tired out after \\ntraining. \\n\\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice \\nsession, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d \\njust gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept \\ndive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off \\ntheir brooms. \\n\\n“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s \\nexactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! \\nSnape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for \\nany excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” \\n\\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these \\nwords. \\n\\n“ Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a \\nmouthful of mud. “When’s he ever refereed a \\nQuidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might \\novertake Slytherin.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to \\ncomplain, too. \\n\\n“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make \\nsure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an \\nexcuse to pick on us.” \\n\\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had \\nanother reason for not wanting Snape near him while \\nhe was playing Quidditch. ... \\n\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another \\nas usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed \\nstraight back to the Gryffindor common room, where \\nhe found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was \\nthe only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry \\nand Ron thought was very good for her. \\n\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry \\nsat down next to him, “I need to concern” He caught \\nsight of Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you? \\n\\nYou look terrible.” \\n\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, \\n\\nHarry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, \\nsinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. \\n\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once. \\n\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested. \\n\\n“ Really break your leg,” said Ron. \\n\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I \\nback out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common \\nroom. How he had managed to climb through the \\nportrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs \\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at \\nonce as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to \\nbunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. \\n\\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who \\nleapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville’s \\nlegs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \\n\\n“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him \\nover to sit with Harry and Ron. \\n\\n“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the \\nlibrary. He said he’d been looking for someone to \\npractice that on.” \\n\\n“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged \\nNeville. “Report him!” \\n\\nNeville shook his head. \\n\\n“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled. \\n\\n“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. \\n“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no \\nreason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.” \\n\\n“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be \\nin Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville \\nchoked out. \\n\\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a \\nChocolate Frog, the very last one from the box \\nHermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to \\nNeville, who looked as though he might cry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The \\nSorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And \\nwhere’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.” \\n\\nNeville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he \\nunwrapped the frog. \\n\\n“Thanks, Harry ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want \\nthe card, you collect them, don’t you?” \\n\\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous \\nWizard card. \\n\\n“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I \\never — ” \\n\\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he \\nlooked up at Ron and Hermione. \\n\\n“I’ve found him\\\\” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I \\ntold you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it \\non the train coming here — listen to this: \\n\\n‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of \\nthe Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the \\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his \\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ \\n\\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so \\nexcited since they’d gotten back the marks for their \\nvery first piece of homework. \\n\\n“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs \\nto the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had \\ntime to exchange mystified looks before she was \\ndashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \\n\\n“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered \\nexcitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a \\nbit of light reading.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet \\nuntil she’d looked something up, and started flicking \\nfrantically through the pages, muttering to herself. \\n\\nAt last she found what she was looking for. \\n\\n“I knew it! I knew it!” \\n\\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. \\nHermione ignored him. \\n\\n“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the \\nonly known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\\\\” \\n\\nThis didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected. \\n\\n“The what?” said Harry and Ron. \\n\\n“Oh, honestly , don’t you two read? Look — read that, \\nthere.” \\n\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and \\nRon read: \\n\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with \\nmaking the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance \\nwith astonishing powers. The Stone will transform \\nany metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of \\nLife, which will make the drinker immortal. \\n\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone \\nover the centuries, but the only Stone currently in \\nexistence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted \\nalchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated \\nhis six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, \\nenjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle \\n(six hundred and fifty-eight). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had \\nfinished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s \\nSorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep \\nit safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew \\nsomeone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone \\nmoved out of Gringotts!” \\n\\n“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever \\ndying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! \\n\\nAnyone would want it.” \\n\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study \\nof Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s \\nnot exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is \\nhe?” \\n\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, \\nwhile copying down different ways of treating werewolf \\nbites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d \\ndo with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t \\nuntil Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that \\nHarry remembered about Snape and the coming \\nmatch. \\n\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I \\ndon’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared \\nto face Snape. I’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe the \\nsmiles off their faces if we win.” \\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” \\nsaid Hermione. \\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became \\nmore and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and \\nHermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, \\neither. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House \\nChampionship was wonderful, no one had done it for \\nseven years, but would they be allowed to, with such \\na biased referee? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, \\nbut he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever \\nhe went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape \\nwas following him, trying to catch him on his own. \\nPotions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly \\ntorture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape \\npossibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s \\nStone? Harry didn’t see how he could — yet he \\nsometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could \\nread minds. \\n\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck \\noutside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron \\nand Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever \\nsee him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call \\ncomforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep \\ntalk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked \\nup his Nimbus Two Thousand. \\n\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in \\nthe stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand \\nwhy they looked so grim and worried, or why they had \\nboth brought their wands to the match. Little did \\nHarry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly \\npracticing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the \\nidea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready \\nto use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to \\nhurt Harry. \\n\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione \\nmuttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. \\n\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.” \\n\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry \\naside. \\n\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever \\nneed an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too \\nmuch.” \\n\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, \\npeering out of the door. “Even — blimey — \\nDumbledore’s come to watch!” \\n\\nHarry’s heart did a somersault. \\n\\n“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make \\nsure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that \\nsilver beard. \\n\\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was \\nsafe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare \\nto try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. \\n\\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as \\nthe teams marched onto the field, something that Ron \\nnoticed, too. \\n\\n“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told \\nHermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!” \\n\\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It \\nwas Malfoy. \\n\\n“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” \\n\\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \\n\\n“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom \\nthis time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, \\nWeasley?” \\n\\nRon didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded \\nHufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit \\na Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers \\ncrossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwho was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the \\nSnitch. \\n\\n“You know how I think they choose people for the \\nGryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes \\nlater, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty \\nfor no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. \\n\\nSee, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s \\nthe Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be \\non the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” \\n\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face \\nMalfoy. \\n\\n“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered. \\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but \\nRon, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, \\nsaid, “You tell him, Neville.” \\n\\n“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than \\nWeasley, and that’s saying something.” \\n\\nRon’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking \\npoint with anxiety about Harry. \\n\\n“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” \\n\\n“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” \\n\\n“What? Where?” \\n\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, \\nwhich drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. \\nHermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, \\nas Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \\n\\n“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted \\nsome money on the ground!” said Malfoy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was \\nhappening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to \\nthe ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the \\nback of his seat to help. \\n\\n“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto \\nher seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — \\nshe didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around \\nunder her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from \\nthe whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. \\n\\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in \\ntime to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing \\nhim by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled \\nout of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch \\nclasped in his hand. \\n\\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one \\ncould ever remember the Snitch being caught so \\nquickly. \\n\\n“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s \\nwon! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked \\nHermione, dancing up and down on her seat and \\nhugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. \\n\\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. \\nHe couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — the game was \\nover; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors \\ncame spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land \\nnearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt \\na hand on his shoulder and looked up into \\nDumbledore’s smiling face. \\n\\n“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only \\nHarry could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been \\nbrooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . \\nexcellent ...” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground. \\n\\n\\n\\nJc Jc Jc \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to \\ntake his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the \\nbroomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling \\nhappier. He’d really done something to be proud of \\nnow — no one could say he was just a famous name \\nany more. The evening air had never smelled so \\nsweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the \\nlast hour in his head, which was a happy blur: \\nGryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; \\nRon and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and \\ndown, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. \\n\\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the \\nwooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its \\nwindows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in \\nthe lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape. ... \\n\\nAnd speaking of Snape . . . \\n\\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of \\nthe castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked \\nas fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. \\nHarry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. \\nHe recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape, \\nsneaking into the forest while everyone else was at \\ndinner — what was going on? \\n\\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand \\nand took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw \\nSnape enter the forest at a run. He followed. \\n\\nThe trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape \\nhad gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, \\nbrushing the top branches of trees until he heard \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvoices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly \\nin a towering beech tree. \\n\\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, \\nholding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through \\nthe leaves. \\n\\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he \\nwasn’t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t \\nmake out the look on his face, but he was stuttering \\nworse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they \\nwere saying. \\n\\n\"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of \\nall p-places, Severus ...” \\n\\n“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his \\nvoice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about \\nthe Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” \\n\\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling \\nsomething. Snape interrupted him. \\n\\n“Have you found out how to get past that beast of \\nHagrid’s yet?” \\n\\n“B-b-but Severus, I — ” \\n\\n“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said \\nSnape, taking a step toward him. \\n\\n“I-I don’t know what you — ” \\n\\n“You know perfectly well what I mean.” \\n\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the \\ntree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \\n\\n“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“B-but I d-d-don’t — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well,” Snape cut in. “Well have another little \\nchat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over \\nand decided where your loyalties lie.” \\n\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the \\nclearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see \\nQuirrell, standing quite still as though he was \\npetrified. \\n\\n\\n\\nJc Jc Jc \\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked. \\n\\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping \\nHarry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, \\nand Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- \\nhanded! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says \\nhe’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! \\nEveryone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re \\nhaving a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and \\nstuff from the kitchens.” \\n\\n“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s \\nfind an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...” \\n\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting \\nthe door behind them, then he told them what he’d \\nseen and heard. \\n\\n“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and \\nSnape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He \\nasked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said \\nsomething about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon \\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from \\nFluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwould have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that \\nSnape needs to break through — ” \\n\\n“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell \\nstands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm. \\n\\n“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN \\nRIDGEBACK \\n\\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d \\nthought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be \\ngetting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though \\nhe’d cracked yet. \\n\\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, \\nRon, and Hermione would press their ears to the door \\nto check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape \\nwas sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which \\nsurely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever \\nHarry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an \\nencouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling \\npeople off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter. \\n\\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the \\nSorcerer’s Stone. She had started drawing up study \\nschedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and \\nRon wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging \\nthem to do the same. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” \\n\\n“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, \\nthat’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” \\n\\n“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded \\nher. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already \\nknow it all.” \\n\\n“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize \\nwe need to pass these exams to get into the second \\nyear? They’re very important, I should have started \\nstudying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into \\nme.” \\n\\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking \\nalong the same lines as Hermione. They piled so \\nmuch homework on them that the Easter holidays \\nweren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It \\nwas hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting \\nthe twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand \\nmovements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron \\nspent most of their free time in the library with her, \\ntrying to get through all their extra work. \\n\\n“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one \\nafternoon, throwing down his quill and looking \\nlongingly out of the library window. It was the first \\nreally fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a \\nclear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in \\nthe air of summer coming. \\n\\nHarry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand \\nMagical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he \\nheard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the \\nlibrary?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind \\nhis back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin \\novercoat. \\n\\n“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their \\ninterest at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He \\nlooked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer \\nNicolas Flamel, are yeh?” \\n\\n“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron \\nimpressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding, \\nit’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” \\n\\n“Shhhh\\\\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if \\nanyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, \\nwhat’s the matter with yeh?” \\n\\n“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a \\nmatter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding \\nthe Stone apart from Fluffy — ” \\n\\n“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see \\nme later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, \\nbut don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ \\ns’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ” \\n\\n“See you later, then,” said Harry. \\n\\nHagrid shuffled off. \\n\\n“What was he hiding behind his back?” said \\nHermione thoughtfully. \\n\\n“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?” \\n\\n“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, \\nwho’d had enough of working. He came back a \\nminute later with a pile of books in his arms and \\nslammed them down on the table. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dragons\\'.” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff \\nabout dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great \\nBritain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon \\nKeeper’s Guide.” \\n\\n“Hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the \\nfirst time I ever met him,” said Harry. \\n\\n“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon \\nbreeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention \\nof 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop \\nMuggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in \\nthe back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, \\nit’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got \\noff wild ones in Romania.” \\n\\n“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh \\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic \\nhas a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind \\nhave to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted \\nthem, to make them forget.” \\n\\n“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione. \\n\\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s \\nhut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all \\nthe curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?” \\nbefore he let them in, and then shut the door quickly \\nbehind them. \\n\\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a \\nwarm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. \\n\\nHagrid made them tea and offered them stoat \\nsandwiches, which they refused. \\n\\n“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around \\nthe bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us \\nwhat’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from \\nFluffy.” \\n\\nHagrid frowned at him. \\n\\n“O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know \\nmeself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I \\nwouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good \\nreason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I \\ns’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how \\nyeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” \\n\\n“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, \\nbut you do know, you know everything that goes on \\nround here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering \\nvoice. Hagrid ’s beard twitched and they could tell he \\nwas smiling. “We only wondered who had done the \\nguarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered \\nwho Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, \\napart from you.” \\n\\nHagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and \\nRon beamed at Hermione. \\n\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... \\nlet’s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some \\no’ the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout \\n— Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” he \\nticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — \\nan’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. \\n\\nHang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor \\nSnape.” \\n\\n“Snape?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, \\nSnape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter \\nsteal it.” \\n\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the \\nsame as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting \\nthe Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the \\nother teachers had guarded it. He probably knew \\neverything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and \\nhow to get past Fluffy. \\n\\n“You’re the only one who knows how to get past \\nFluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. \\n\\n“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even \\none of the teachers?” \\n\\n“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said \\nHagrid proudly. \\n\\n“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the \\nothers. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m \\nboiling.” \\n\\n“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him \\nglance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. \\n\\n“Hagrid — what’s that?” \\n\\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of \\nthe fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \\n\\n“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \\n“That’s — er ...” \\n\\n“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching \\nover the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve \\ncost you a fortune.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the \\nvillage havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards \\nwith a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of \\nit, ter be honest.” \\n\\n“But what are you going to do with it when it’s \\nhatched?” said Hermione. \\n\\n“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling \\na large book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the \\nlibrary — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — \\nit’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep \\nthe egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on \\n’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ \\nbrandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ \\nsee here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I \\ngot there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They’re rare, \\nthem.” \\n\\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione \\ndidn’t. \\n\\n“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said. \\n\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily \\nas he stoked the fire. \\n\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what \\nmight happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was \\nhiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \\n\\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron \\nsighed, as evening after evening they struggled \\nthrough all the extra homework they were getting. \\nHermione had now started making study schedules \\nfor Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry \\nanother note from Hagrid. He had written only two \\nwords: It’s hatching. \\n\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to \\nthe hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it. \\n\\n“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going \\nto see a dragon hatching?” \\n\\n“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s \\nnothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone \\nfinds out what he’s doing — ” \\n\\n“Shut up!” Harry whispered. \\n\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped \\ndead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t \\nlike the look on Malfoy’s face at all. \\n\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology \\nand in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to \\nHagrid’s with the other two during morning break. \\nWhen the bell sounded from the castle at the end of \\ntheir lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels \\nat once and hurried through the grounds to the edge \\nof the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed \\nand excited. \\n\\n“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside. \\n\\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep \\ncracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny \\nclicking noise was coming from it. \\n\\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched \\nwith bated breath. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg \\nsplit open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It \\nwasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a \\ncrumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge \\ncompared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout \\nwith wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, \\norange eyes. \\n\\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \\n\\n“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached \\nout a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at \\nhis fingers, showing pointed fangs. \\n\\n“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid. \\n\\n“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian \\nRidgebacks grow, exactly?” \\n\\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly \\ndrained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to \\nthe window. \\n\\n“What’s the matter?” \\n\\n“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains \\n— it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.” \\n\\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a \\ndistance there was no mistaking him. \\n\\nMalfoy had seen the dragon. \\n\\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face \\nduring the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione \\nvery nervous. They spent most of their free time in \\nHagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \\n\\n“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.” \\n\\n\\n\\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times \\nin length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its \\nnostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping \\nduties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. \\nThere were empty brandy bottles and chicken \\nfeathers all over the floor. \\n\\n“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking \\nat the dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me \\nnow, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mommy?” \\n\\n“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear. \\n\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and \\nNorbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy \\ncould go to Dumbledore at any moment.” \\n\\nHagrid bit his lip. \\n\\n“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ \\ndump him, can’t.” \\n\\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. \\n\\n“Charlie,” he said. \\n\\n“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?” \\n\\n“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. \\nStudying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. \\nCharlie can take care of him and then put him back \\nin the wild!” \\n\\n“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?” \\n\\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send \\nan owl to Charlie to ask him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night \\nfound Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the \\ncommon room, long after everyone else had gone to \\nbed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight \\nwhen the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out \\nof nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. \\nHe had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed \\nNorbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \\n\\n“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which \\nwas wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going \\nto be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that \\ndragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but \\nthe way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a \\nfluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off \\nfor frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a \\nlullaby.” \\n\\nThere was a tap on the dark window. \\n\\n“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll \\nhave Charlie’s answer!” \\n\\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the \\nnote. \\n\\nDear Ron, \\n\\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to \\ntake the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy \\ngetting him here. I think the best thing will be to send \\nhim over with some friends of mine who are coming to \\nvisit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen \\ncarrying an illegal dragon. \\n\\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at \\nmidnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and \\ntake him away while it’s still dark. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSend me an answer as soon as possible. \\n\\n\\n\\nLove, \\n\\nCharlie \\n\\nThey looked at one another. \\n\\n“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It \\nshouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big \\nenough to cover two of us and Norbert.” \\n\\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that \\nthe other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of \\nNorbert — and Malfoy. \\n\\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten \\nhand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t \\nknow whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — \\nwould she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, \\nthough, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty \\nshade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were \\npoisonous. \\n\\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing \\nat the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in \\nbed. \\n\\n“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that \\nfeels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam \\nPomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he \\ncould come and have a good laugh at me. He kept \\nthreatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told \\nher it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I \\nshouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s \\nwhy he’s doing this.” \\n\\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said \\nHermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the \\ncontrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \\n\\n“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. \\n\\n“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s \\nletter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to \\nknow we’re getting rid of Norbert.” \\n\\nHarry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. \\nMadam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made \\nthem leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \\n\\n“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told \\nHermione. “We haven’t got time to send Charlie \\nanother owl, and this could be our only chance to get \\nrid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got \\nthe Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about \\nthat.” \\n\\nThey found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a \\nbandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who \\nopened a window to talk to them. \\n\\n“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky \\nstage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” \\n\\nWhen they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes \\nfilled with tears, although that might have been \\nbecause Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \\n\\n“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ \\nplayin’ — he’s only a baby, after all.” \\n\\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the \\nwindows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to \\nthe castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly \\nenough. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time \\ncame for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t \\nbeen so worried about what they had to do. It was a \\nvery dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late \\narriving at Hagrid ’s hut because they’d had to wait for \\nPeeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, \\nwhere he’d been playing tennis against the wall. \\n\\nHagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \\n\\n“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” \\nsaid Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his \\nteddy bear in case he gets lonely.” \\n\\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that \\nsounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his \\nhead torn off. \\n\\n“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and \\nHermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak \\nand stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy will \\nnever forget you!” \\n\\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the \\ncastle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as \\nthey heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the \\nentrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up \\nanother staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s \\nshortcuts didn’t make the work much easier. \\n\\n“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the \\ncorridor beneath the tallest tower. \\n\\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them \\nalmost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were \\nalready invisible, they shrank into the shadows, \\nstaring at the dark outlines of two people grappling \\nwith each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair \\nnet, had Malfoy by the ear. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from \\nSlytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the \\nnight, how dare you — ” \\n\\n“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s \\ncoming — he’s got a dragon!” \\n\\n“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! \\nCome on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, \\nMalfoy!” \\n\\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower \\nseemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not \\nuntil they’d stepped out into the cold night air did \\nthey throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe \\nproperly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \\n\\n“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!” \\n\\n“Don’t,” Harry advised her. \\n\\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert \\nthrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, \\nfour broomsticks came swooping down out of the \\ndarkness. \\n\\nCharlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed \\nHarry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so \\nthey could suspend Norbert between them. They all \\nhelped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry \\nand Hermione shook hands with the others and \\nthanked them very much. \\n\\nAt last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their \\nhearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was \\noff them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — \\nwhat could spoil their happiness? \\n\\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the \\nstairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face \\nloomed suddenly out of the darkness. \\n\\n“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.” \\n\\nThey’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST \\n\\nThings couldn’t have been worse. \\n\\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s \\nstudy on the first floor, where they sat and waited \\nwithout saying a word to each other. Hermione was \\ntrembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories \\nchased each other around Harry’s brain, each more \\nfeeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were \\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. They were \\ncornered. How could they have been so stupid as to \\nforget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that \\nProfessor McGonagall would accept for their being out \\nof bed and creeping around the school in the dead of \\nnight, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, \\nwhich was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add \\nNorbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as \\nwell be packing their bags already. \\n\\nHad Harry thought that things couldn’t have been \\nworse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall \\nappeared, she was leading Neville. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the \\nother two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I \\nheard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he \\nsaid you had a drag — ” \\n\\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but \\nProfessor McGonagall had seen. She looked more \\nlikely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over \\nthe three of them. \\n\\n“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch \\nsays you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one \\no’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.” \\n\\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to \\nanswer a teacher’s question. She was staring at her \\nslippers, as still as a statue. \\n\\n“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” \\nsaid Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius \\nto work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and- \\nbull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed \\nand into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose \\nyou think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the \\nstory and believed it, too?” \\n\\nHarry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him \\nwithout words that this wasn’t true, because Neville \\nwas looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering \\nNeville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to \\ntry and find them in the dark, to warn them. \\n\\n“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four \\nstudents out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of \\nsuch a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you \\nhad more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought \\nGryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of \\nyou will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. \\nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naround school at night, especially these days, it’s very \\ndangerous — and fifty points will be taken from \\nGryffindor.” \\n\\n“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the \\nlead he’d won in the last Quidditch match. \\n\\n“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, \\nbreathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \\n\\n“Professor — please — ” \\n\\n“You can’t—” \\n\\n“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get \\nback to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed \\nof Gryffindor students.” \\n\\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in \\nlast place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance \\nGryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as \\nthough the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. \\nHow could they ever make up for this? \\n\\nHarry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville \\nsobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. \\nHarry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort \\nhim. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the \\ndawn. What would happen when the rest of \\nGryffindor found out what they’d done? \\n\\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses \\nthat recorded the House points the next day thought \\nthere ’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly \\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? \\nAnd then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, \\nthe famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch \\nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a \\ncouple of other stupid first years. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired \\npeople at the school, Harry was suddenly the most \\nhated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on \\nhim, because everyone had been longing to see \\nSlytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry \\nwent, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their \\nvoices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other \\nhand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and \\ncheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!” \\n\\nOnly Ron stood by him. \\n\\n“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George \\nhave lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been \\nhere, and people still like them.” \\n\\n“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one \\ngo, though, have they?” said Harry miserably. \\n\\n“Well — no,” Ron admitted. \\n\\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry \\nswore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t \\nhis business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking \\naround and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that \\nhe went to Wood and offered to resign from the \\nQuidditch team. \\n\\n“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? \\n\\nHow are we going to get any points back if we can’t \\nwin at Quidditch?” \\n\\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the \\nteam wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if \\nthey had to speak about him, they called him “the \\nSeeker.” \\n\\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t \\nhave as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwell-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. \\nHermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in \\nclass, keeping her head down and working in silence. \\n\\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far \\naway. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off \\nhis misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to \\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to \\nremember the ingredients in complicated potions, \\nlearn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates \\nof magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ... \\n\\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to \\nstart, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in \\nanything that didn’t concern him was put to an \\nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on his \\nown one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering \\nfrom a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he \\nheard Quirrell’s voice. \\n\\n“No — no — not again, please — ” \\n\\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. \\nHarry moved closer. \\n\\n“All right — all right — ” he heard Quirrell sob. \\n\\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the \\nclassroom straightening his turban. He was pale and \\nlooked as though he was about to cry. He strode out \\nof sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed \\nhim. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had \\ndisappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was \\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry \\nwas halfway toward it before he remembered what \\nhe’d promised himself about not meddling. \\n\\nAll the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s \\nStones that Snape had just left the room, and from \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhat Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking \\nwith a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to \\nhave given in at last. \\n\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was \\ntesting Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d \\nheard. \\n\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told \\nhim how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ” \\n\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione. \\n\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him \\nwithout asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the \\nthousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a \\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a \\ngiant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?” \\n\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s \\neyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. \\n\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done \\nages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown \\nout for sure.” \\n\\n“But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too \\nscared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he \\ndoesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and \\nthat he was nowhere near the third floor — who do \\nyou think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a \\nsecret we hate him, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it \\nup to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life \\ndepended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the \\nmore students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. \\nAnd don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about \\nthe Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.” \\n\\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“If we just do a bit of poking around — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking \\naround.” \\n\\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to \\nlearn the names of its moons. \\n\\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, \\nHermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They \\nwere all the same: \\n\\nYour detention will take place at eleven o’clock \\ntonight. \\n\\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. \\n\\nProfessor M. McGonagall \\n\\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in \\nthe furor over the points they’d lost. He half expected \\nHermione to complain that this was a whole night of \\nstudying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, \\nshe felt they deserved what they’d got. \\n\\nAt eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron \\nin the common room and went down to the entrance \\nhall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so \\nwas Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had \\ngotten a detention, too. \\n\\n“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading \\nthem outside. \\n\\n“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule \\nagain, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh \\nyes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you \\nask me. ... It’s just a pity they let the old \\npunishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in \\nmy office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever \\nneeded. ... Right, off we go, and don’t think of running \\noff, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” \\n\\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville \\nkept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment \\nwas going to be. It must be something really horrible, \\nor Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted. \\n\\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it \\nkept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry \\ncould see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then \\nthey heard a distant shout. \\n\\n“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.” \\n\\nHarry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working \\nwith Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must \\nhave showed in his face, because Filch said, “I \\nsuppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with \\nthat oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest \\nyou’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come \\nout in one piece.” \\n\\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy \\nstopped dead in his tracks. \\n\\n“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite \\nas cool as usual. “We can’t go in there at night — \\nthere’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I \\nheard.” \\n\\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a \\nchoking noise. \\n\\n“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice \\ncracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them \\nwerewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, \\nFang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, \\nand a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. \\n\\n“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour \\nalready. All right, Harry, Hermione?” \\n\\n“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said \\nFilch coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.” \\n\\n“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at \\nFilch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do \\nthat. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” \\n\\n“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of \\nthem,” he added nastily, and he turned and started \\nback toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the \\ndarkness. \\n\\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid. \\n\\n“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was \\npleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. \\n\\n“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said \\nHagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got \\nter pay fer it.” \\n\\n“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I \\nthought we’d be copying lines or something, if my \\nfather knew I was doing this, he’d — ” \\n\\n“ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid \\ngrowled. “Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone? \\nYeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think \\nyer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back \\noff ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but \\nthen dropped his gaze. \\n\\n“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, \\n\\n’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ \\nI don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a \\nmoment.” \\n\\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his \\nlamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding \\nearth track that disappeared into the thick black \\ntrees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked \\ninto the forest. \\n\\n“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on \\nthe ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. \\nThere’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. \\nThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead \\nlast Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor \\nthing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.” \\n\\n“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us \\nfirst?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his \\nvoice. \\n\\n“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh \\nif yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the \\npath. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties \\nan’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood \\nall over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around \\nsince last night at least.” \\n\\n“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s \\nlong teeth. \\n\\n“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. \\n“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, \\nNeville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us \\nfinds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ \\nif anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll \\nall come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.” \\n\\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it \\nthey reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, \\nHermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, \\nNeville, and Fang took the right. \\n\\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. \\nEvery now and then a ray of moonlight through the \\nbranches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the \\nfallen leaves. \\n\\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \\n\\n“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry \\nasked. \\n\\n“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch \\na unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never \\nknew one ter be hurt before.” \\n\\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could \\nhear running water; there must be a stream \\nsomewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn \\nblood here and there along the winding path. \\n\\n“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ \\nworry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ \\nthen well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” \\n\\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them \\noff the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an \\narrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready \\nto fire. The three of them listened. Something was \\nslithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a \\ncloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nup the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound \\nfaded away. \\n\\n“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here \\nthat shouldn’ be.” \\n\\n“A werewolf?” Harry suggested. \\n\\n“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, \\nneither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but \\ncareful, now.” \\n\\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the \\nfaintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, \\nsomething definitely moved. \\n\\n“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m \\narmed!” \\n\\nAnd into the clearing came — was it a man, or a \\nhorse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, \\nbut below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body \\nwith a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws \\ndropped. \\n\\n“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are \\nyeh?” \\n\\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand. \\n\\n“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a \\ndeep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?” \\n\\n“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his \\ncrossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest. \\nThis is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the \\nway. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, \\nyou two. He’s a centaur.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And \\ndo you learn much, up at the school?” \\n\\n“Erm — ” \\n\\n“A bit,” said Hermione timidly. \\n\\n“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He \\nflung back his head and stared at the sky. “Mars is \\nbright tonight.” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad \\nwe’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn \\nbin hurt — you seen anythin’?” \\n\\nRonan didn’t answer immediately. He stared \\nunblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \\n\\n“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. \\n\\n“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, \\nRonan? Anythin’ unusual?” \\n\\n“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while \\nHagrid watched him impatiently. “Unusually bright.” \\n\\n“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit \\nnearer home,” said Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed \\nanythin’ strange?” \\n\\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he \\nsaid, “The forest hides many secrets.” \\n\\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid \\nraise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nblack-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than \\nRonan. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?” \\n\\n“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?” \\n\\n“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you \\nseen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn \\nbin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” \\n\\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked \\nskyward. \\n\\n“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply. \\n\\n“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of \\nyou do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be \\noff, then.” \\n\\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, \\nstaring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until \\nthe trees blocked their view. \\n\\n“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight \\nanswer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not \\ninterested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” \\n\\n“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione. \\n\\n“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves \\nmostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if \\never I want a word. They’re deep, mind, centaurs ... \\nthey know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.” \\n\\n“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” \\nsaid Harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask \\nme, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never \\nheard anythin’ like it before.” \\n\\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry \\nkept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the \\nnasty feeling they were being watched. He was very \\nglad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. \\nThey had just passed a bend in the path when \\nHermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm. \\n\\n“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” \\n\\n“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the \\npath, I’ll come back for yeh!” \\n\\nThey heard him crashing away through the \\nundergrowth and stood looking at each other, very \\nscared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the \\nrustling of leaves around them. \\n\\n“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” \\nwhispered Hermione. \\n\\n“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got \\nNeville ... it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.” \\n\\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper \\nthan usual. Harry’s seemed to be picking up every \\nsigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going \\non? Where were the others? \\n\\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s \\nreturn. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. \\nHagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked \\nup behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville \\nhad panicked and sent up the sparks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket \\nyou two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — \\nNeville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go \\nwith Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a \\nwhisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time \\nfrightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” \\n\\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with \\nMalfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an \\nhour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path \\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees \\nwere so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be \\ngetting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a \\ntree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing \\naround in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing \\nahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient \\noak. \\n\\n“Look — ” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop \\nMalfoy. \\n\\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. \\nThey inched closer. \\n\\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry \\nhad never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its \\nlong, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where \\nit had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on \\nthe dark leaves. \\n\\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering \\nsound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on \\nthe edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the \\nshadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the \\nground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and \\nFang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the \\nunicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the \\nanimals side, and began to drink its blood. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ” \\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did \\nFang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked \\nright at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its \\nfront. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry \\n— he couldn’t move for fear. \\n\\nThen a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his \\nhead; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half \\nblinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves \\nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean \\nover Harry, charging at the figure. \\n\\nThe pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his \\nknees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he \\nlooked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was \\nstanding over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one \\nlooked younger; he had white-blond hair and a \\npalomino body. \\n\\n“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to \\nhis feet. \\n\\n“Yes — thank you — what was that?” \\n\\nThe centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue \\neyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at \\nHarry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, \\nlivid, on Harry’s forehead. \\n\\n“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get \\nback to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — \\nespecially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker \\nthis way. \\n\\n“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered \\nhimself on to his front legs so that Harry could \\nclamber onto his back. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from \\nthe other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came \\nbursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and \\nsweaty. \\n\\n“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You \\nhave a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are \\nyou a common mule?” \\n\\n“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the \\nPotter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the \\nbetter.” \\n\\n“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. \\n“Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set \\nourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what \\nis to come in the movements of the planets?” \\n\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze \\nthought he was acting for the best,” he said in his \\ngloomy voice. \\n\\nBane kicked his back legs in anger. \\n\\n“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs \\nare concerned with what has been foretold! It is not \\nour business to run around like donkeys after stray \\nhumans in our forest!” \\n\\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, \\nso that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \\n\\n“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at \\nBane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or \\nhave the planets not let you in on that secret? I set \\nmyself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, \\nyes, with humans alongside me if I must.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on \\nas best he could, they plunged off into the trees, \\nleaving Ronan and Bane behind them. \\n\\nHarry didn’t have a clue what was going on. \\n\\n“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that \\nthing you saved me from, anyway?” \\n\\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his \\nhead bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did \\nnot answer Harry’s question. They made their way \\nthrough the trees in silence for so long that Harry \\nthought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. \\nThey were passing through a particularly dense patch \\nof trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \\n\\n“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is \\nused for?” \\n\\n“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve \\nonly used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” \\n\\n“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a \\nunicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to \\nlose, and everything to gain, would commit such a \\ncrime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even \\nif you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. \\nYou have slain something pure and defenseless to \\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a \\ncursed life, from the moment the blood touches your \\nlips.” \\n\\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was \\ndappled silver in the moonlight. \\n\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If \\nyou’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t \\nit?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay \\nalive long enough to drink something else — \\nsomething that will bring you back to full strength \\nand power — something that will mean you can never \\ndie. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the \\nschool at this very moment?” \\n\\n“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! \\nBut I don’t understand who — ” \\n\\n“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years \\nto return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting \\ntheir chance?” \\n\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly \\naround Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, \\nhe seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told \\nhim on the night they had met: “Some say he died. \\nCodswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough \\nhuman left in him to die.” \\n\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ” \\n\\n“Harry! Harry, are you all right?” \\n\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, \\nHagrid puffing along behind her. \\n\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was \\nsaying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that \\nclearing back there.” \\n\\n“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as \\nHagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are \\nsafe now.” \\n\\nHarry slid off his back. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets \\nhave been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. \\nI hope this is one of those times.” \\n\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the \\nforest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. \\n\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, \\nwaiting for them to return. He shouted something \\nabout Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him \\nawake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- \\neyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what \\nhad happened in the forest. \\n\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in \\nfront of the fire. He was still shaking. \\n\\n“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and \\nVoldemort’s waiting in the forest ... and all this time \\nwe thought Snape just wanted to get rich. ...” \\n\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified \\nwhisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. \\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening. \\n\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. ... \\nBane was furious ... he was talking about interfering \\nwith what the planets say is going to happen. ... They \\nmust show that Voldemort’s coming back. ... Bane \\nthinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I \\nsuppose that’s written in the stars as well.” \\n\\n“Will you stop saying the name\\\\” Ron hissed. \\n\\n“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the \\nStone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will \\nbe able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose \\nBane 11 be happy.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word \\nof comfort. \\n\\n“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one \\nYou-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore \\naround, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, \\nwho says the centaurs are right? It sounds like \\nfortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says \\nthat’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” \\n\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. \\nThey went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But \\nthe night’s surprises weren’t over. \\n\\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his \\nInvisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. \\nThere was a note pinned to it: \\n\\nJust in case. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR \\n\\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember \\nhow he had managed to get through his exams when \\nhe half expected Voldemort to come bursting through \\nthe door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and \\nthere could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and \\nwell behind the locked door. \\n\\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large \\nclassroom where they did their written papers. They \\nhad been given special, new quills for the exams, \\nwhich had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating \\nspell. \\n\\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick \\ncalled them one by one into his class to see if they \\ncould make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. \\nProfessor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse \\ninto a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the \\nsnuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. \\nSnape made them all nervous, breathing down their \\nnecks while they tried to remember how to make a \\nForgetfulness potion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the \\nstabbing pains in his forehead, which had been \\nbothering him ever since his trip into the forest. \\nNeville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves \\nbecause Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that \\nHarry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except \\nthat it was now worse than ever because there was a \\nhooded figure dripping blood in it. \\n\\nMaybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry \\nhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have \\nscars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and \\nHermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as \\nHarry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, \\nbut he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they \\nwere so busy with their studying they didn’t have \\nmuch time to fret about what Snape or anyone else \\nmight be up to. \\n\\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour \\nof answering questions about batty old wizards who’d \\ninvented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, \\nfree for a whole wonderful week until their exam \\nresults came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns \\ntold them to put down their quills and roll up their \\nparchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the \\nrest. \\n\\n“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said \\nHermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto \\nthe sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the \\n1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of \\nElfric the Eager.” \\n\\nHermione always liked to go through their exam \\npapers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, \\nso they wandered down to the lake and flopped under \\na tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was \\nbasking in the warm shallows. \\n\\n\\n\\n“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching \\nout on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, \\n\\nHarry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly \\nwe’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” \\n\\nHarry was rubbing his forehead. \\n\\n“I wish I knew what this means\\\\” he burst out angrily. \\n“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but \\nnever as often as this.” \\n\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. \\n\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning ... it \\nmeans danger’s coming. ...” \\n\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. \\n\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione ’s right, the Stone’s safe as \\nlong as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never \\nhad any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. \\nHe nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to \\ntry it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch \\nfor England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” \\n\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking \\nfeeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, \\nsomething important. When he tried to explain this, \\nHermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last \\nnight and was halfway through my Transfiguration \\nnotes before I remembered we’d done that one.” \\n\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have \\nanything to do with work, though. He watched an owl \\nflutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a \\nnote clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwho ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray \\nDumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to \\nget past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — \\n\\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet. \\n\\n“Where ’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. \\n\\n“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had \\nturned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” \\n\\n“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \\n\\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, \\nscrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid \\nwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a \\nstranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in \\nhis pocket? How many people wander around with \\ndragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they \\nfound Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it \\nbefore?” \\n\\n“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, \\nsprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t \\nanswer. \\n\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; \\nhis trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was \\nshelling peas into a large bowl. \\n\\n“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got \\ntime fer a drink?” \\n\\n“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \\n\\n“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you \\nsomething. You know that night you won Norbert? \\nWhat did the stranger you were playing cards with \\nlook like?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dunno said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his \\ncloak off.” \\n\\n\\n\\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his \\neyebrows. \\n\\n“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in \\nthe Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the \\nvillage. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I \\nnever saw his face, he kept his hood up.” \\n\\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \\n\\n“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you \\nmention Hogwarts at all?” \\n\\n“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried \\nto remember. “Yeah ... he asked what I did, an’ I told \\nhim I was gamekeeper here. ... He asked a bit about \\nthe sorta creatures I look after ... so I told him ... an’ I \\nsaid what I’d always really wanted was a dragon ... \\nan’ then ... I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept \\nbuyin’ me drinks. ... Let’s see ... yeah, then he said he \\nhad the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I \\nwanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he \\ndidn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told him, \\nafter Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...” \\n\\n“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” \\n\\nHarry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \\n\\n“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh \\nmeet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a \\npiece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ \\nplay him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter \\nsleep — ” \\n\\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I \\nsaid it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” \\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other \\nat all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, \\nwhich seemed very cold and gloomy after the \\ngrounds. \\n\\n“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid \\ntold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was \\neither Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it \\nmust’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just \\nhope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us \\nup if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s \\noffice?” \\n\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign \\npointing them in the right direction. They had never \\nbeen told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know \\nanyone who had been sent to see him. \\n\\n“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice \\nsuddenly rang across the hall. \\n\\n“What are you three doing inside?” \\n\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of \\nbooks. \\n\\n“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said \\nHermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \\n\\n“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall \\nrepeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to \\nwant to do. “Why?” \\n\\nHarry swallowed — now what? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he \\nhadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils \\nflared. \\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said \\ncoldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry \\nof Magic and flew off for London at once.” \\n\\n“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?” \\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, \\nhe has many demands on his time — ” \\n\\n“But this is important.” \\n\\n“Something you have to say is more important than \\nthe Ministry of Magic, Potter?” \\n\\n“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \\n“Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” \\n\\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it \\nwasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out \\nof her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. \\n\\n“How do you know — ?” she spluttered. \\n\\n“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that \\nsomeone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to \\ntalk to Professor Dumbledore.” \\n\\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she \\nsaid finally. “I don’t know how you found out about \\nthe Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal \\nit, it’s too well protected.” \\n\\n“But Professor — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said \\nshortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen \\nbooks. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy \\nthe sunshine.” \\n\\nBut they didn’t. \\n\\n“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor \\nMcGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going \\nthrough the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out \\neverything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore \\nout of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of \\nMagic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns \\nup.” \\n\\n“But what can we — ” \\n\\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. \\nSnape was standing there. \\n\\n“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. \\n\\nThey stared at him. \\n\\n“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, \\nwith an odd, twisted smile. \\n\\n“We were — ” Harry began, without any idea what he \\nwas going to say. \\n\\n“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging \\naround like this, people will think you’re up to \\nsomething. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose \\nany more points, can it?” \\n\\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape \\ncalled them back. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings \\nand I will personally make sure you are expelled. \\n\\nGood day to you.” \\n\\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom. \\n\\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \\n\\n“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered \\nurgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape \\n— wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he \\nleaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.” \\n\\n“Why me?” \\n\\n“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be \\nwaiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a \\nhigh voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I \\nthink I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ” \\n\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go \\nand watch out for Snape. \\n\\n“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” \\nHarry told Ron. “Come on.” \\n\\nBut that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had \\nthey reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest \\nof the school than Professor McGonagall turned up \\nagain and this time, she lost her temper. \\n\\n“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a \\npack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this \\nnonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here \\nagain, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! \\n\\nYes, Weasley, from my own House!” \\n\\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry \\nhad just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and \\nHermione came in. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and \\nasked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for \\nFlitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only \\njust got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” \\n\\n“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. \\n\\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes \\nwere glittering. \\n\\n“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and \\nget to the Stone first.” \\n\\n“You’re mad!” said Ron. \\n\\n“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall \\nand Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” \\n\\n“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? \\nIf Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming \\nback! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was \\ntrying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to \\nget expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a \\nschool for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter \\nanymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you \\nand your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House \\nCup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, \\nI’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for \\nVoldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later \\nthan I would have, because I’m never going over to \\nthe Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor \\ntonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! \\nVoldemort killed my parents, remember?” \\n\\nHe glared at them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. \\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just \\nlucky I got it back.” \\n\\n“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. \\n\\n“All — all three of us?” \\n\\n“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go \\nalone?” \\n\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you \\nthink you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go \\nand look through my books, there might be \\nsomething useful. ...” \\n\\n“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” \\n\\n“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick \\ntold me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve \\npercent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out \\nafter that.” \\n\\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in \\nthe common room. Nobody bothered them; none of \\nthe Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any \\nmore, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been \\nupset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her \\nnotes, hoping to come across one of the \\nenchantments they were about to try to break. Harry \\nand Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were \\nthinking about what they were about to do. \\n\\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \\n\\n“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan \\nfinally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran \\nupstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had \\ngiven him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on \\nFluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing. \\n\\nHe ran back down to the common room. \\n\\n“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it \\ncovers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet \\nwandering along on its own — ” \\n\\n“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of \\nthe room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, \\nclutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d \\nbeen making another bid for freedom. \\n\\n“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly \\nputting the cloak behind his back. \\n\\nNeville stared at their guilty faces. \\n\\n“You’re going out again,” he said. \\n\\n“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t \\nyou go to bed, Neville?” \\n\\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. \\nThey couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape \\nmight even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \\n\\n“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught \\nagain. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” \\n\\n“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is \\nimportant.” \\n\\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do \\nsomething desperate. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in \\nfront of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!” \\n\\n“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and \\ndon’t be an idiot — ” \\n\\n“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t \\nthink you should be breaking any more rules! And \\nyou were the one who told me to stand up to people!” \\n\\n“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. \\n\\n“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” \\n\\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the \\ntoad, who leapt out of sight. \\n\\n“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his \\nfists. “I’m ready!” \\n\\nHarry turned to Hermione. \\n\\n“Do something,” he said desperately. \\n\\nHermione stepped forward. \\n\\n“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” \\nShe raised her wand. \\n\\n“Petrificus Totalusl” she cried, pointing it at Neville. \\n\\nNeville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang \\ntogether. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he \\nstood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. \\n\\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were \\njammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes \\nwere moving, looking at them in horror. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered. \\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. \\n“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” \\n\\n“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. \\n\\n“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they \\nstepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. \\n\\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t \\nfeel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, \\nevery statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant \\nbreath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on \\nthem. \\n\\nAt the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. \\nNorris skulking near the top. \\n\\n“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in \\nHarry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they \\nclimbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her \\nlamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. \\n\\nThey didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the \\nstaircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing \\nhalfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would \\ntrip. \\n\\n“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed \\ntoward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \\n“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you \\nghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” \\n\\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at \\nthem. \\n\\n“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping \\naround unseen.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had a sudden idea. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody \\nBaron has his own reasons for being invisible.” \\n\\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught \\nhimself in time and hovered about a foot off the \\nstairs. \\n\\n“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said \\ngreasily. “My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you \\n— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old \\nPeevsie his little joke, sir.” \\n\\n“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay \\naway from this place tonight.” \\n\\n“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up \\nin the air again. “Hope your business goes well, \\n\\nBaron, I’ll not bother you.” \\n\\nAnd he scooted off. \\n\\n“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron. \\n\\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the \\nthird-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. \\n\\n“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s \\nalready got past Fluffy.” \\n\\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress \\nupon all three of them what was facing them. \\nUnderneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \\n\\n“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. \\n“You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” \\n\\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re coming,” said Hermione. \\n\\nHarry pushed the door open. \\n\\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their \\nears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their \\ndirection, even though it couldn’t see them. \\n\\n“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered. \\n\\n“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it \\nthere.” \\n\\n“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said \\nHarry. “Well, here goes ...” \\n\\nHe put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t \\nreally a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes \\nbegan to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the \\ndog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell \\nto its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast \\nasleep. \\n\\n“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out \\nof the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They \\ncould feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they \\napproached the giant heads. \\n\\n“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, \\npeering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, \\nHermione?” \\n\\n“No, I don’t!” \\n\\n“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully \\nover the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the \\ntrapdoor, which swung up and open. \\n\\n“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing \\ndown, we’ll just have to drop.” \\n\\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to \\nget his attention and pointed at himself. \\n\\n“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I \\ndon’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to \\nHermione so she can keep him asleep.” \\n\\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ \\nsilence, the dog growled and twitched, but the \\nmoment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its \\ndeep sleep. \\n\\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the \\ntrapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. \\n\\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was \\nhanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at \\nRon and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t \\nfollow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to \\nDumbledore, right?” \\n\\n“Right,” said Ron. \\n\\n“See you in a minute, I hope. ...” \\n\\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as \\nhe fell down, down, down and — \\n\\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he \\nlanded on something soft. He sat up and felt around, \\nhis eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he \\nwas sitting on some sort of plant. \\n\\n“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a \\npostage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a \\nsoft landing, you can jump!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to \\nHarry. \\n\\n“What’s this stuff?” were his first words. \\n\\n“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here \\nto break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” \\n\\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark \\nfrom the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She \\nlanded on Harry’s other side. \\n\\n“We must be miles under the school,” she said. \\n\\n“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron. \\n\\n“Lucky\\\\” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” \\n\\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She \\nhad to struggle because the moment she had landed, \\nthe plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils \\naround her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs \\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers \\nwithout their noticing. \\n\\nHermione had managed to free herself before the \\nplant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in \\nhorror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off \\nthem, but the more they strained against it, the \\ntighter and faster the plant wound around them. \\n\\n“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what \\nthis is — it’s Devil’s Snare!” \\n\\n“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a \\ngreat help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop \\nthe plant from curling around his neck. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said \\nHermione. \\n\\n“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, \\nwrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \\n\\n“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor \\nSprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ” \\n\\n“So light a fire!” Harry choked. \\n\\n“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione \\ncried, wringing her hands. \\n\\n“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A \\nWITCH OR NOT?” \\n\\n“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her \\nwand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of \\nthe same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at \\nthe plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it \\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light \\nand warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself \\nfrom their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \\n\\n“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” \\nsaid Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat \\noff his face. \\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his \\nhead in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” \\n\\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone \\npassageway, which was the only way forward. \\n\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the \\ngentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The \\npassageway sloped downward, and Harry was \\nreminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nheart, he remembered the dragons said to be \\nguarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a \\ndragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad \\nenough ... \\n\\n“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered. \\n\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to \\nbe coming from up ahead. \\n\\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?” \\n\\n“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.” \\n\\n“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” \\n\\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw \\nbefore them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling \\narching high above them. It was full of small, jewel- \\nbright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the \\nroom. On the opposite side of the chamber was a \\nheavy wooden door. \\n\\n“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” \\nsaid Ron. \\n\\n“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, \\nbut I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . \\nwell, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.” \\n\\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, \\nand sprinted across the room. He expected to feel \\nsharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, \\nbut nothing happened. He reached the door \\nuntouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. \\n\\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved \\nat the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when \\nHermione tried her Alohomora Charm. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now what?” said Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,” \\nsaid Hermione. \\n\\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — \\nglittering? \\n\\n“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re \\nkeys\\\\ Winged keys — look carefully. So that must \\nmean ...” he looked around the chamber while the \\nother two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes — \\nlook! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the \\ndoor!” \\n\\n“But there are hundreds of them!” \\n\\nRon examined the lock on the door. \\n\\n“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably \\nsilver, like the handle.” \\n\\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the \\nair, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They \\ngrabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted \\nand dived so quickly it was almost impossible to \\ncatch one. \\n\\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest \\nSeeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting \\nthings other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving \\nabout through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he \\nnoticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it \\nhad already been caught and stuffed roughly into the \\nkeyhole. \\n\\n“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — \\nthere — no, there — with bright blue wings — the \\nfeathers are all crumpled on one side.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was \\npointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off \\nhis broom. \\n\\n“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking \\nhis eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you \\ncome at it from above — Hermione, stay below and \\nstop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it. \\nRight, NOW!” \\n\\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key \\ndodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped \\ntoward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a \\nnasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone \\nwith one hand. Ron and Hermione ’s cheers echoed \\naround the high chamber. \\n\\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the \\nkey struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock \\nand turned — it worked. The moment the lock had \\nclicked open, the key took flight again, looking very \\nbattered now that it had been caught twice. \\n\\n“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the \\ndoor handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. \\n\\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see \\nanything at all. But as they stepped into it, light \\nsuddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing \\nsight. \\n\\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, \\nbehind the black chessmen, which were all taller than \\nthey were and carved from what looked like black \\nstone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were \\nthe white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered \\nslightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. \\n\\n“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our \\nway across the room.” \\n\\n\\n\\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door. \\n\\n“How?” said Hermione nervously. \\n\\n“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be \\nchessmen.” \\n\\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out \\nto touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang \\nto life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight \\nturned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. \\n\\n“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” \\n\\nThe black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other \\ntwo. \\n\\n“This needs thinking about. ...” he said. “I suppose \\nwe’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. \\n\\n\\n\\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron \\nthink. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or \\nanything, but neither of you are that good at chess — \\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us \\nwhat to do.” \\n\\n“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and \\nHermione, you go there instead of that castle.” \\n\\n“What about you?” \\n\\n“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because \\nat these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned \\ntheir backs on the white pieces and walked off the \\nboard, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, \\nand Hermione took. \\n\\n“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering \\nacross the board. “Yes ... look ...” \\n\\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares. \\n\\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved \\nsilently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were \\ntrembling. What if they lost? \\n\\n“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.” \\n\\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight \\nwas taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor \\nand dragged him off the board, where he lay quite \\nstill, facedown. \\n\\n“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. \\n“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go \\non.” \\n\\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces \\nshowed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp \\nblack players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only \\njust noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in \\ndanger. He himself darted around the board, taking \\nalmost as many white pieces as they had lost black \\nones. \\n\\n“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me \\nthink — let me think ...” \\n\\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes ...” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got \\nto be taken.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted. \\n\\n“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make \\nsome sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me — \\nthat leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” \\n\\n“But — ” \\n\\n“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” \\n\\n“Ron — ” \\n\\n“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the \\nStone!” \\n\\nThere was no alternative. \\n\\n“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. \\n“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve \\nwon.” \\n\\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. \\nShe struck Ron hard across the head with her stone \\narm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione \\nscreamed but stayed on her square — the white \\nqueen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d \\nbeen knocked out. \\n\\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. \\n\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at \\nHarry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and \\nbowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last \\ndesperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione \\ncharged through the door and up the next \\npassageway. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What if he’s — ?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince \\nhimself. “What do you reckon’s next?” \\n\\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; \\nFlitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall \\ntransfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that \\nleaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” \\n\\nThey had reached another door. \\n\\n“All right?” Harry whispered. \\n\\n“Go on.” \\n\\nHarry pushed it open. \\n\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of \\nthem pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes \\nwatering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a \\ntroll even larger than the one they had tackled, out \\ncold with a bloody lump on its head. \\n\\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry \\nwhispered as they stepped carefully over one of its \\nmassive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” \\n\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly \\ndaring to look at what came next — but there was \\nnothing very frightening in here, just a table with \\nseven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a \\nline. \\n\\n“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?” \\n\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a \\nfire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t \\nordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading \\nonward. They were trapped. \\n\\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to \\nthe bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: \\n\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, \\n\\nTwo of us will help you, whichever you would find, \\n\\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead, \\n\\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead, \\n\\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine, \\n\\nThree of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. \\n\\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, \\n\\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues \\nfour: \\n\\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide \\n\\nYou will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; \\n\\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end, \\n\\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend; \\n\\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size, \\n\\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; \\n\\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right \\n\\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first \\nsight \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw \\nthat she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like \\ndoing. \\n\\n“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s \\nlogic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t \\ngot an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.” \\n\\n“But so will we, won’t we?” \\n\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need \\nis here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; \\ntwo are wine; one will get us safely through the black \\nfire, and one will get us back through the purple.” \\n\\n“But how do we know which to drink?” \\n\\n“Give me a minute.” \\n\\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she \\nwalked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to \\nherself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her \\nhands. \\n\\n“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us \\nthrough the black fire — toward the Stone.” \\n\\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle. \\n\\n“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. \\n“That’s hardly one swallow.” \\n\\nThey looked at each other. \\n\\n“Which one will get you back through the purple \\nflames?” \\n\\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end \\nof the line. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and \\nget Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, \\nthey’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — \\ngo straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to \\nDumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold \\nSnape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, \\nreally.” \\n\\n“But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with him?” \\n\\n“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, \\npointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.” \\n\\nHermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at \\nHarry and threw her arms around him. \\n\\n“Hermionel” \\n\\n“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” \\n\\n“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very \\nembarrassed, as she let go of him. \\n\\n“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There \\nare more important things — friendship and bravery \\nand — oh Harry — be carefull” \\n\\n“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is \\nwhich, aren’t you?” \\n\\n“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from \\nthe round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \\n\\n“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously. \\n\\n“No — but it’s like ice.” \\n\\n“Quick, go, before it wears off.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good luck — take care — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“GO!” \\n\\nHermione turned and walked straight through the \\npurple fire. \\n\\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest \\nbottle. He turned to face the black flames. \\n\\n“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle \\nin one gulp. \\n\\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He \\nput the bottle down and walked forward; he braced \\nhimself, saw the black flames licking his body, but \\ncouldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see \\nnothing but dark fire — then he was on the other \\nside, in the last chamber. \\n\\nThere was already someone there — but it wasn’t \\nSnape. It wasn’t even Voldemort. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES \\n\\nIt was Quirrell. \\n\\n“You\\\\” gasped Harry. \\n\\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all. \\n\\n“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be \\nmeeting you here, Potter.” \\n\\n“But I thought — Snape — ” \\n\\n“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual \\nquivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, \\nSeverus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to \\nhave him swooping around like an overgrown bat. \\n\\nNext to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- \\nstuttering P-Professor Quirrell?” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it \\ncouldn’t. \\n\\n“But Snape tried to kill me!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss \\nGranger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed \\nto set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She \\nbroke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds \\nand I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed \\nit before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a \\ncountercurse, trying to save you.” \\n\\n“Snape was trying to save me?” \\n\\n“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think \\nhe wanted to referee your next match? He was trying \\nto make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really ... he \\nneedn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with \\nDumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought \\nSnape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he \\ndid make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of \\ntime, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.” \\n\\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin \\nair and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \\n\\n“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the \\nschool on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d \\nseen me coming to look at what was guarding the \\nStone.” \\n\\n“ You let the troll in?” \\n\\n“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must \\nhave seen what I did to the one in the chamber back \\nthere? Unfortunately, while everyone else was \\nrunning around looking for it, Snape, who already \\nsuspected me, went straight to the third floor to head \\nme off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to \\ndeath, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to \\nbite Snape ’s leg off properly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this \\ninteresting mirror.” \\n\\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was \\nstanding behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \\n\\n“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell \\nmurmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust \\nDumbledore to come up with something like this . . . \\nbut he’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time he \\ngets back. ...” \\n\\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell \\ntalking and stop him from concentrating on the \\nmirror. \\n\\n“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” he blurted out. \\n\\n“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to \\nlook at the back. “He was on to me by that time, \\ntrying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all \\nalong. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, \\nwhen I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...” \\n\\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and \\nstared hungrily into it. \\n\\n“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting it to my master ... \\nbut where is it?” \\n\\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but \\nthey didn’t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving \\nhis whole attention to the mirror. \\n\\n“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” \\n\\n“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. \\nHe was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nknow? They loathed each other. But he never wanted \\nyou dead.” \\n\\n“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought \\nSnape was threatening you. \\n\\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across \\nQuirrell’s face. \\n\\n“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my \\nmaster’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am \\nweak — ” \\n\\n“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” \\nHarry gasped. \\n\\n“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I \\nmet him when I traveled around the world. A foolish \\nyoung man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about \\ngood and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong \\nI was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, \\nand those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have \\nserved him faithfully, although I have let him down \\nmany times. He has had to be very hard on me.” \\nQuirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive \\nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from \\nGringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me \\n. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on \\nme. ...” \\n\\nQuirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering \\nhis trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so \\nstupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken \\nhands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. \\n\\nQuirrell cursed under his breath. \\n\\n“I don’t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror? \\nShould I break it?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry’s mind was racing. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at \\nthe moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before \\nQuirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see \\nmy self finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s \\nhidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing \\nwhat I’m up to? \\n\\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass \\nwithout Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his \\nankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell \\nignored him. He was still talking to himself. \\n\\n“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help \\nme, Master!” \\n\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice \\nseemed to come from Quirrell himself. \\n\\n“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...” \\n\\nQuirrell rounded on Harry. \\n\\n“Yes — Potter — come here.” \\n\\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding \\nHarry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. \\n\\n“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror \\nand tell me what you see.” \\n\\nHarry walked toward him. \\n\\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie \\nabout what I see, that’s all. \\n\\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in \\nthe funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nturban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the \\nmirror, and opened them again. \\n\\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. \\nBut a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It \\nput its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- \\nred stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its \\npocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy \\ndrop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — \\nhe’d gotten the Stone. \\n\\n“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?” \\nHarry screwed up his courage. \\n\\n“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he \\ninvented. “I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” \\n\\nQuirrell cursed again. \\n\\n“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, \\nhe felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he \\nmake a break for it? \\n\\nBut he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice \\nspoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips. \\n\\n“He lies ... He lies ...” \\n\\n“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me \\nthe truth! What did you just see?” \\n\\nThe high voice spoke again. \\n\\n“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...” \\n\\n“Master, you are not strong enough!” \\n\\n“I have strength enough ... for this. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the \\nspot. He couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he \\nwatched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap \\nhis turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. \\nQuirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. \\n\\nThen he turned slowly on the spot. \\n\\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a \\nsound. Where there should have been a back to \\nQuirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible \\nface Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with \\nglaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \\n\\n“Harry Potter ...” it whispered. \\n\\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs \\nwouldn’t move. \\n\\n“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere \\nshadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can \\nshare another’s body . . . but there have always been \\nthose willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ... \\nUnicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks \\n. . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the \\nforest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be \\nable to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t \\nyou give me that Stone in your pocket?” \\n\\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into \\nHarry’s legs. He stumbled backward. \\n\\n“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your \\nown life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as \\nyour parents. ... They died begging me for mercy. ...” \\n\\n“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that \\nVoldemort could still see him. The evil face was now \\nsmiling. \\n\\n“How touching ...” it hissed. “I always value bravery. \\n\\n... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your \\nfather first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but \\nyour mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to \\nprotect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you \\nwant her to have died in vain.” \\n\\n“NEVER!” \\n\\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort \\nscreamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry \\nfelt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At once, a \\nneedle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his \\nhead felt as though it was about to split in two; he \\nyelled, struggling with all his might, and to his \\nsurprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head \\nlessened — he looked around wildly to see where \\nQuirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, \\nlooking at his fingers — they were blistering before his \\neyes. \\n\\n“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, \\nand Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, \\nlanding on top of him, both hands around Harry’s \\nneck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with \\npain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. \\n\\n“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my \\nhands!” \\n\\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground \\nwith his knees, let go of his neck and stared, \\nbewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they \\nlooked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched \\nVoldemort. \\n\\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, \\nbut Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed \\nQuirrell’s face — \\n\\n“AAAARGH!” \\n\\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and \\nthen Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare \\nskin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only \\nchance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in \\nenough pain to stop him from doing a curse. \\n\\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, \\nand hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed \\nand tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s \\nhead was building — he couldn’t see — he could only \\nhear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells \\nof, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in \\nHarry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!” \\n\\nHe felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew \\nall was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... \\ndown ... \\n\\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The \\nSnitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too \\nheavy. \\n\\nHe blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of \\nglasses. How strange. \\n\\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus \\nDumbledore swam into view above him. \\n\\n“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The \\nStone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick — \\n\\n\\n\\n“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the \\ntimes,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the \\nStone.” \\n\\n“Then who does? Sir, I — ” \\n\\n“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me \\nthrown out.” \\n\\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized \\nhe must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed \\nwith white linen sheets, and next to him was a table \\npiled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \\n\\n“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said \\nDumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the \\ndungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a \\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school \\nknows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George \\nWeasley were responsible for trying to send you a \\ntoilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse \\nyou. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be \\nvery hygienic, and confiscated it.” \\n\\n“How long have I been in here?” \\n\\n“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger \\nwill be most relieved you have come round, they have \\nbeen extremely worried.” \\n\\n“But sir, the Stone — ” \\n\\n“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the \\nStone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although \\nyou were doing very well on your own, I must say.” \\n\\n“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?” \\n\\n“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I \\nreached London than it became clear to me that the \\nplace I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived \\njust in time to pull Quirrell off you — ” \\n\\n“It was you.” \\n\\n“I feared I might be too late.” \\n\\n“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the \\nStone much longer — ” \\n\\n“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly \\nkilled you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid \\nit had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.” \\n\\n“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — \\nNicolas Flamel — ” \\n\\n“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, \\nsounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing \\nproperly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a \\nlittle chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” \\n\\n“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?” \\n\\n“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in \\norder and then, yes, they will die.” \\n\\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on \\nHarry’s face. \\n\\n“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, \\nbut to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well- \\norganized mind, death is but the next great \\nadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a \\nwonderful thing. As much money and life as you \\ncould want! The two things most human beings would \\nchoose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a \\nknack of choosing precisely those things that are \\nworst for them.” \\n\\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed \\na little and smiled at the ceiling. \\n\\n“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if \\nthe Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” \\n\\n“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper \\nname for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the \\nthing itself.” \\n\\n“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of \\ncoming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has \\nhe?” \\n\\n“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there \\nsomewhere, perhaps looking for another body to \\nshare ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He \\nleft Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his \\nfollowers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while \\nyou may only have delayed his return to power, it will \\nmerely take someone else who is prepared to fight \\nwhat seems a losing battle next time — and if he is \\ndelayed again, and again, why, he may never return \\nto power.” \\n\\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made \\nhis head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some \\nother things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ... \\nthings I want to know the truth about. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and \\nterrible thing, and should therefore be treated with \\ngreat caution. However, I shall answer your questions \\nunless I have a very good reason not to, in which case \\nI beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.” \\n\\n“Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother \\nbecause she tried to stop him from killing me. But \\nwhy would he want to kill me in the first place?” \\n\\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \\n\\n“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. \\n\\nNot today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it \\nfrom your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . \\nI know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, \\nyou will know.” \\n\\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \\n\\n“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” \\n\\n“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing \\nVoldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t \\nrealize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you \\nleaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to \\nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person \\nwho loved us is gone, will give us some protection \\nforever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, \\ngreed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, \\ncould not touch you for this reason. It was agony to \\ntouch a person marked by something so good.” \\n\\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out \\non the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his \\neyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, \\nHarry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know \\nwho sent it to me?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my \\npossession, and I thought you might like it.” \\nDumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things ... your \\nfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens \\nto steal food when he was here.” \\n\\n“And there’s something else ...” \\n\\n“Fire away.” \\n\\n“Quirrell said Snape — ” \\n\\n“Professor Snape, Harry.” \\n\\n“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he \\nhated my father. Is that true?” \\n\\n“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike \\nyourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did \\nsomething Snape could never forgive.” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“He saved his life.” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way \\npeople’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape \\ncouldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... I do \\nbelieve he worked so hard to protect you this year \\nbecause he felt that would make him and your father \\neven. Then he could go back to hating your father’s \\nmemory in peace. ...” \\n\\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head \\npound, so he stopped. \\n\\n“And sir, there’s one more thing ...” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just the one?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?” \\n\\n“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of \\nmy more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, \\nthat’s saying something. You see, only one who \\nwanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — \\nwould be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see \\nthemselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My \\nbrain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough \\nquestions. I suggest you make a start on these \\nsweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was \\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a \\nvomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve \\nrather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe \\nwith a nice toffee, don’t you?” \\n\\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his \\nmouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!” \\n\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but \\nvery strict. \\n\\n“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded. \\n\\n“Absolutely not.” \\n\\n“You let Professor Dumbledore in. ...” \\n\\n“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite \\ndifferent. You need rest.” \\n\\n“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go \\non, Madam Pomfrey ...” \\n\\n“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.” \\n\\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Harryl” \\n\\n\\n\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him \\nagain, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his \\nhead was still very sore. \\n\\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — \\nDumbledore was so worried — ” \\n\\n“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What \\nreally happened?” \\n\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story \\nis even more strange and exciting than the wild \\nrumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the \\nmirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione \\nwere a very good audience; they gasped in all the \\nright places, and when Harry told them what was \\nunder Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \\n\\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just \\ngoing to die?” \\n\\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — \\nwhat was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is \\nbut the next great adventure.’ ” \\n\\n“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, \\nlooking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. \\n\\n“So what happened to you two?” said Harry. \\n\\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought \\nRon round — that took a while — and we were \\ndashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when \\nwe met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — \\nhe just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and \\nhurtled off to the third floor.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. \\n“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” \\n\\n“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say \\n— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” \\n\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny \\nman, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give \\nme a chance. I think he knows more or less \\neverything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he \\nhad a pretty good idea we were going to try, and \\ninstead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to \\nhelp. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find \\nout how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought \\nI had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...” \\n\\n“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said \\nRon proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end- \\nof-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and \\nSlytherin won, of course — you missed the last \\nQuidditch match, we were steamrollered by \\nRavenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” \\n\\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \\n\\n“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she \\nsaid firmly. \\n\\n\\n\\n•k k k \\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to \\nnormal. \\n\\n“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as \\nshe straightened his many candy boxes. “I can, can’t \\nI?” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to \\ngo,” she said sniffily, as though in her opinion \\nProfessor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts \\ncould be. “And you have another visitor.” \\n\\n“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?” \\n\\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual \\nwhen he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be \\nallowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at \\nhim, and burst into tears. \\n\\n“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his \\nface in his hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past \\nFluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn’t \\nknow, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a \\ndragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked \\nout an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” \\n\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking \\nwith grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into \\nhis beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, \\nthis is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found \\nout even if you hadn’t told him.” \\n\\n“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the \\nname!” \\n\\n“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so \\nshocked, he stopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m \\ncalling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we \\nsaved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a \\nChocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...” \\n\\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and \\nsaid, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.” \\n\\n“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry \\nanxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter \\nfix it. ’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead — \\nanyway, got y eh this ...” \\n\\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. \\nHarry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard \\nphotographs. Smiling and waving at him from every \\npage were his mother and father. \\n\\n“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, \\naskin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh \\nlike it?” \\n\\nHarry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood. \\n\\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast \\nalone that night. He had been held up by Madam \\nPomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one \\nlast checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It \\nwas decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and \\nsilver to celebrate Slytherin ’s winning the House Cup \\nfor the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing \\nthe Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the \\nHigh Table. \\n\\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and \\nthen everybody started talking loudly at once. He \\nslipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the \\nGryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that \\npeople were standing up to look at him. \\n\\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The \\nbabble died away. \\n\\n“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. \\n\\n“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing \\nwaffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious \\nfeast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads \\nare all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhole summer ahead to get them nice and empty \\nbefore next year starts. ... \\n\\n“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs \\nawarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, \\nGryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in \\nthird, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; \\nRavenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and \\nSlytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” \\n\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the \\nSlytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging \\nhis goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. \\n\\n“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. \\n“However, recent events must be taken into account.” \\n\\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded \\na little. \\n\\n“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute \\npoints to dish out. Let me see. Yes ... \\n\\n“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” \\n\\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish \\nwith a bad sunburn. \\n\\n\"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has \\nseen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty \\npoints.” \\n\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; \\nthe stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be \\nheard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you \\nknow! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s \\ngiant chess set!” \\n\\nAt last there was silence again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of \\ncool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House \\nfifty points.” \\n\\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly \\nsuspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up \\nand down the table were beside themselves — they \\nwere a hundred points up. \\n\\n“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore. \\n\\nThe room went deadly quiet. \"... for pure nerve and \\noutstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty \\npoints.” \\n\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while \\nyelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now \\nhad four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly \\nthe same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House \\nCup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one \\nmore point. \\n\\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell \\nsilent. \\n\\n“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, \\nsmiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up \\nto our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our \\nfriends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville \\nLongbottom.” \\n\\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well \\nhave thought some sort of explosion had taken place, \\nso loud was the noise that erupted from the \\nGryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up \\nto yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, \\ndisappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He \\nhad never won so much as a point for Gryffindor \\nbefore. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs \\nand pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind \\nCurse put on him. \\n\\n“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of \\napplause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were \\ncelebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little \\nchange of decoration.” \\n\\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green \\nhangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; \\nthe huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering \\nGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking \\nProfessor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced \\nsmile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once \\nthat Snape ’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one \\njot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life \\nwould be back to normal next year, or as normal as it \\never was at Hogwarts. \\n\\nIt was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than \\nwinning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out \\nmountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight. \\n\\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results \\nwere still to come, but come they did. To their great \\nsurprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; \\nHermione, of course, had the best grades of the first \\nyears. Even Neville scraped through, his good \\nHerbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions \\none. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as \\nstupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he \\nhad passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you \\ncouldn’t have everything in life. \\n\\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their \\ntrunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking \\nin a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all \\nstudents, warning them not to use magic over the \\nholidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthese,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to \\ntake them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across \\nthe lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; \\ntalking and laughing as the countryside became \\ngreener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor \\nBeans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off \\ntheir wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; \\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at \\nKing’s Cross station. \\n\\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the \\nplatform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket \\nbarrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and \\nthrees so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting \\nout of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \\n\\n“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, \\n“both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” \\n\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look \\nforward to.” \\n\\nPeople jostled them as they moved forward toward the \\ngateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them \\ncalled: \\n\\n“Bye, Harry!” \\n\\n“See you, Potter!” \\n\\n“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him. \\n\\n“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. \\n\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway \\ntogether. \\n\\n“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she \\nwasn’t pointing at Ron. \\n\\n“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see \\n“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” \\n\\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them. \\n\\n“Busy year?” she said. \\n\\n“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the \\nsweater, Mrs. Weasley.” \\n\\n“Oh, it was nothing, dear.” \\n\\n“Ready, are you?” \\n\\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still \\nmustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, \\ncarrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary \\npeople. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, \\nlooking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \\n\\n“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley. \\n\\n“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry \\nup, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away. \\n\\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and \\nHermione. \\n\\n“See you over the summer, then.” \\n\\n“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said \\nHermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, \\nshocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at \\nthe grin that was spreading over his face. “ They don’t \\nknow we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m \\ngoing to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
